East Liverpool (forty four miles) and Wellsville (forty eight miles) are long stretches of pottery and tile making works, both of them on the Ohio shore. There is nothing there to lure us, however, and we determined to camp on the banks of Yellow Creek (fifty one miles), a peaceful little Ohio stream some two rods in width, its mouth crossed by two great iron spans, for railway and highway.
