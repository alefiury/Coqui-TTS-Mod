Shippingsport (thirty two miles), on the left bank, where we stopped this noon for eggs, butter, and fresh water, is on a narrow hill bench-a dry, woe begone hamlet, side tracked from the path of the world's progress. While I was on shore, negotiating with the sleepy storekeeper, Pilgrim and her crew waited alongside the flatboat which serves as the town ferry.
