Butter a baking dish, sprinkle with bread crumbs, lay a sea trout upon it, cover with crumbs, dot with butter, squeeze over the juice of half a lemon, and bake, adding enough water to keep from burning. Brown a tablespoonful of flour in butter, add the liquid drained from the fish, one cupful each of mushroom and oyster liquor, and a wineglassful of Madeira.
