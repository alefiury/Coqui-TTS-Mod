Lovely was the maid of Pohja, Famed on land, on water peerless, On the arch of air high seated, Brightly shining on the rainbow, Clad in robes of dazzling lustre, Clad in raiment white and shining. There she wove a golden fabric, Interwoven all with silver, And her shuttle was all golden, And her comb was all of silver.
