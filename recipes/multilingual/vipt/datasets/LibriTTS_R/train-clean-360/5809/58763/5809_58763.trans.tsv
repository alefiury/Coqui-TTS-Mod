5809_58763_000004_000004	In former times some scientists supposed that it was a fine rain that fell from the higher regions of the atmosphere. Others supposed it to be an emanation from the earth, while still others supposed it was an exudation from the stars.

5809_58763_000007_000004	It has been stated in a former chapter on evaporation that the capacity of the air for holding moisture in a transparent form depends upon its temperature.	It has been stated in a former chapter on evaporation that the capacity of the air for holding moisture in a transparent form depends upon its temperature.
5809_58763_000007_000006	If it is 60 degrees Fahrenheit the air will retain six grains of transparent moisture to the square foot of air, while at 80 degrees it will contain nearly eleven grains.	If it is sixty degrees Fahrenheit the air will retain six grains of transparent moisture to the square foot of air, while at eighty degrees it will contain nearly eleven grains.
5809_58763_000007_000007	When the air is charged with this vapor to the point of saturation (which point varies with the temperature) a slight depression of the temperature is sufficient to condense this vapor into cloud or drops of water.

5809_58763_000007_000009	He weighed out pieces of equal weight and attached a number of them to the upper side of a board and as many more to the lower side, and exposed it to the night air under varying conditions.

5809_58763_000007_000010	One experiment was made with a board four feet from the earth, so that half of the bunches of cotton faced the ground and the other half the sky.	One experiment was made with a board four feet from the earth, so that half of the bunches of cotton faced the ground and the other half the sky.
5809_58763_000007_000011	He found upon weighing these after a night's exposure under a clear sky that the cotton wool on top of the board had gained fourteen grains in weight from the moisture, or dew, that had formed upon it, while the same amount of cotton on the under side of the board had only increased four grains.

5809_58763_000007_000015	It has been determined that substances like grass and green leaves of all kinds, hay and straw, while they are poor conductors of heat, are excellent radiators.

5809_58763_000007_000016	In another chapter we have referred to this quality of straw, that is taken advantage of by the inhabitants of hot countries in the manufacture of ice and in our own land for storing it.

5809_58763_000009_000004	From what has gone before it will be seen that if the atmosphere is not charged with moisture up to the point of saturation it will require a greater amount of depression of temperature to cause condensation, and this is why we usually have heavier dews in June when the air is more highly charged with moisture than we do in August when it is dry.

5809_58763_000011_000005	The moon does not revolve upon its own axis like the earth, therefore the same side or a portion of it is exposed to the sun for 14 days.	The moon does not revolve upon its own axis like the earth, therefore the same side or a portion of it is exposed to the sun for fourteen days.
5809_58763_000011_000008	There are but few days in summer when there is not a haze in the atmosphere, although we call the sky clear, which intensifies the light and gives everything a warmer tone. The heat coming from a full moon on a clear night is absorbed in causing the aqueous vapors that are partly condensed in the higher regions of the atmosphere, to be reabsorbed into transparent vapor.

5809_58763_000011_000009	This clears away the heat screen in the atmosphere and allows radiation to go on more rapidly at the earth's surface, and thus cools it to a greater extent when the moon is shining brightly than when it is dark and in the shadow of the earth.

Frost-which of course is but frozen dew-at this season of the year will form on a still autumn night, although the atmosphere at some distance above the ground is some degrees above the freezing point.
