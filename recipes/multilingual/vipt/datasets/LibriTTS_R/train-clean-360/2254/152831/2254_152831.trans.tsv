"Farewell!" we cried to the humdrum and the yoke of the hireling years; Just like a pack of school-boys, and the big crowd cheered us good-bye. Never were hearts so uplifted, never were hopes so high.	"Farewell!" we cried to our dearests; little we cared for their tears.

We flung ourselves in the struggle, packing our grub in relays, Step by step to the summit in the bale of the winter days.

Oh, how we cursed their weakness, anguish they could not tell, Breaking their hearts in our passion, lashing them on till they fell!	"Klondike or bust!" rang the slogan; every man for his own.

We hated those driving before us; we dreaded those pressing behind; We cursed the slow current that bore us; we prayed to the God of the wind.

We spun like a chip in a mill-race; our hearts hammered under the test; Then--oh, the relief on each chill face!--we soared into sunlight and rest.
