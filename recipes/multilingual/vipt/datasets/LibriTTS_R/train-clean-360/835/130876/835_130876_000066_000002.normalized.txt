Man uses his right hand more often than his left, and consequently his various instruments and equipment (staircases, locks, watch springs, etc) are designed to be used in a right to left manner. Now then, nature has generally obeyed this law in coiling her shells. They're right handed with only rare exceptions, and when by chance a shell's spiral is left-handed, collectors will pay its weight in gold for it.
