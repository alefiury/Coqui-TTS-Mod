7956_245687_000003_000000	We now consider the union of the soul with the body; and concerning this there are eight points of inquiry:	We now consider the union of the soul with the body; and concerning this there are eight points of inquiry:
7956_245687_000004_000000	(1) Whether the intellectual principle is united to the body as its form?	(one) Whether the intellectual principle is united to the body as its form?
7956_245687_000005_000000	(2) Whether the intellectual principle is multiplied numerically according to the number of bodies; or is there one intelligence for all men?	(two) Whether the intellectual principle is multiplied numerically according to the number of bodies; or is there one intelligence for all men?
7956_245687_000006_000000	(3) Whether in the body the form of which is an intellectual principle, there is some other soul?	(three) Whether in the body the form of which is an intellectual principle, there is some other soul?
7956_245687_000007_000000	(4) Whether in the body there is any other substantial form?	(four) Whether in the body there is any other substantial form?
7956_245687_000008_000000	(5) Of the qualities required in the body of which the intellectual principle is the form?	(five) Of the qualities required in the body of which the intellectual principle is the form?
7956_245687_000009_000000	(6) Whether it be united to such a body by means of another body?	(six) Whether it be united to such a body by means of another body?
7956_245687_000010_000000	(7) Whether by means of an accident?	(seven) Whether by means of an accident?
7956_245687_000013_000000	Whether the Intellectual Principle Is United to the Body As Its Form?	Whether the Intellectual Principle Is United to the Body As Its Form?
7956_245687_000014_000000	Objection 1: It seems that the intellectual principle is not united to the body as its form.	Objection one: It seems that the intellectual principle is not united to the body as its form.
7956_245687_000015_000002	Therefore the intellect is not united to the body as its form.	Therefore the intellect is not united to the body as its form.
7956_245687_000016_000001	But the form of the thing understood is not received into the intellect materially and individually, but rather immaterially and universally: otherwise the intellect would not be capable of the knowledge of immaterial and universal objects, but only of individuals, like the senses.	But the form of the thing understood is not received into the intellect materially and individually, but rather immaterially and universally: otherwise the intellect would not be capable of the knowledge of immaterial and universal objects, but only of individuals, like the senses.
7956_245687_000016_000002	Therefore the intellect is not united to the body as its form.	Therefore the intellect is not united to the body as its form.
7956_245687_000018_000002	Therefore it is not united to the body as its form.	Therefore it is not united to the body as its form.
7956_245687_000019_000001	But to be united to matter belongs to the form by reason of its nature; because form is the act of matter, not by an accidental quality, but by its own essence; otherwise matter and form would not make a thing substantially one, but only accidentally one. Therefore a form cannot be without its own proper matter.	But to be united to matter belongs to the form by reason of its nature; because form is the act of matter, not by an accidental quality, but by its own essence; otherwise matter and form would not make a thing substantially one, but only accidentally one. Therefore a form cannot be without its own proper matter.
7956_245687_000019_000003	Therefore the intellectual principle is not united to the body as its form.	Therefore the intellectual principle is not united to the body as its form.
7956_245687_000020_000001	But the difference which constitutes man is "rational," which is applied to man on account of his intellectual principle.	But the difference which constitutes man is "rational," which is applied to man on account of his intellectual principle.
7956_245687_000020_000002	Therefore the intellectual principle is the form of man.	Therefore the intellectual principle is the form of man.
7956_245687_000021_000001	For that whereby primarily anything acts is a form of the thing to which the act is to be attributed: for instance, that whereby a body is primarily healed is health, and that whereby the soul knows primarily is knowledge; hence health is a form of the body, and knowledge is a form of the soul.	For that whereby primarily anything acts is a form of the thing to which the act is to be attributed: for instance, that whereby a body is primarily healed is health, and that whereby the soul knows primarily is knowledge; hence health is a form of the body, and knowledge is a form of the soul.
7956_245687_000021_000004	For the soul is the primary principle of our nourishment, sensation, and local movement; and likewise of our understanding.	For the soul is the primary principle of our nourishment, sensation, and local movement; and likewise of our understanding.
7956_245687_000021_000005	Therefore this principle by which we primarily understand, whether it be called the intellect or the intellectual soul, is the form of the body.	Therefore this principle by which we primarily understand, whether it be called the intellect or the intellectual soul, is the form of the body.
7956_245687_000022_000000	But if anyone says that the intellectual soul is not the form of the body he must first explain how it is that this action of understanding is the action of this particular man; for each one is conscious that it is himself who understands.	But if anyone says that the intellectual soul is not the form of the body he must first explain how it is that this action of understanding is the action of this particular man; for each one is conscious that it is himself who understands.
7956_245687_000022_000003	We must therefore say either that Socrates understands by virtue of his whole self, as Plato maintained, holding that man is an intellectual soul; or that intelligence is a part of Socrates.	We must therefore say either that Socrates understands by virtue of his whole self, as Plato maintained, holding that man is an intellectual soul; or that intelligence is a part of Socrates.
7956_245687_000022_000005	But one cannot sense without a body: therefore the body must be some part of man.	But one cannot sense without a body: therefore the body must be some part of man.
7956_245687_000023_000000	The Commentator held that this union is through the intelligible species, as having a double subject, in the possible intellect, and in the phantasms which are in the corporeal organs.	The Commentator held that this union is through the intelligible species, as having a double subject, in the possible intellect, and in the phantasms which are in the corporeal organs.
7956_245687_000023_000001	Thus through the intelligible species the possible intellect is linked to the body of this or that particular man.	Thus through the intelligible species the possible intellect is linked to the body of this or that particular man.
7956_245687_000023_000002	But this link or union does not sufficiently explain the fact, that the act of the intellect is the act of Socrates.	But this link or union does not sufficiently explain the fact, that the act of the intellect is the act of Socrates.
7956_245687_000023_000005	Therefore, as the species of colors are in the sight, so are the species of phantasms in the possible intellect. Now it is clear that because the colors, the images of which are in the sight, are on a wall, the action of seeing is not attributed to the wall: for we do not say that the wall sees, but rather that it is seen.	Therefore, as the species of colors are in the sight, so are the species of phantasms in the possible intellect. Now it is clear that because the colors, the images of which are in the sight, are on a wall, the action of seeing is not attributed to the wall: for we do not say that the wall sees, but rather that it is seen.
7956_245687_000024_000000	Some, however, tried to maintain that the intellect is united to the body as its motor; and hence that the intellect and body form one thing so that the act of the intellect could be attributed to the whole.	Some, however, tried to maintain that the intellect is united to the body as its motor; and hence that the intellect and body form one thing so that the act of the intellect could be attributed to the whole.
7956_245687_000024_000001	This is, however, absurd for many reasons.	This is, however, absurd for many reasons.
7956_245687_000024_000002	First, because the intellect does not move the body except through the appetite, the movement of which presupposes the operation of the intellect.	First, because the intellect does not move the body except through the appetite, the movement of which presupposes the operation of the intellect.
7956_245687_000024_000003	The reason therefore why Socrates understands is not because he is moved by his intellect, but rather, contrariwise, he is moved by his intellect because he understands.	The reason therefore why Socrates understands is not because he is moved by his intellect, but rather, contrariwise, he is moved by his intellect because he understands.
7956_245687_000024_000005	Whereas the act of intellect remains in the agent, and does not pass into something else, as does the action of heating. Therefore the action of understanding cannot be attributed to Socrates for the reason that he is moved by his intellect.	Whereas the act of intellect remains in the agent, and does not pass into something else, as does the action of heating. Therefore the action of understanding cannot be attributed to Socrates for the reason that he is moved by his intellect.
7956_245687_000024_000006	Thirdly, because the action of a motor is never attributed to the thing moved, except as to an instrument; as the action of a carpenter to a saw.	Thirdly, because the action of a motor is never attributed to the thing moved, except as to an instrument; as the action of a carpenter to a saw.
7956_245687_000024_000007	Therefore if understanding is attributed to Socrates, as the action of what moves him, it follows that it is attributed to him as to an instrument.	Therefore if understanding is attributed to Socrates, as the action of what moves him, it follows that it is attributed to him as to an instrument.
7956_245687_000025_000000	There remains, therefore, no other explanation than that given by Aristotle--namely, that this particular man understands, because the intellectual principle is his form.	There remains, therefore, no other explanation than that given by Aristotle-namely, that this particular man understands, because the intellectual principle is his form.
7956_245687_000025_000001	Thus from the very operation of the intellect it is made clear that the intellectual principle is united to the body as its form.	Thus from the very operation of the intellect it is made clear that the intellectual principle is united to the body as its form.
7956_245687_000026_000001	Now the proper operation of man as man is to understand; because he thereby surpasses all other animals.	Now the proper operation of man as man is to understand; because he thereby surpasses all other animals.
7956_245687_000026_000002	Whence Aristotle concludes (Ethic.	Whence Aristotle concludes (Ethic.
7956_245687_000026_000004	Man must therefore derive his species from that which is the principle of this operation.	Man must therefore derive his species from that which is the principle of this operation.
7956_245687_000026_000006	It follows therefore that the intellectual principle is the proper form of man.	It follows therefore that the intellectual principle is the proper form of man.
7956_245687_000027_000001	And the higher we advance in the nobility of forms, the more we find that the power of the form excels the elementary matter; as the vegetative soul excels the form of the metal, and the sensitive soul excels the vegetative soul.	And the higher we advance in the nobility of forms, the more we find that the power of the form excels the elementary matter; as the vegetative soul excels the form of the metal, and the sensitive soul excels the vegetative soul.
7956_245687_000027_000002	Now the human soul is the highest and noblest of forms.	Now the human soul is the highest and noblest of forms.
7956_245687_000027_000004	This power is called the intellect.	This power is called the intellect.
7956_245687_000028_000000	It is well to remark that if anyone holds that the soul is composed of matter and form, it would follow that in no way could the soul be the form of the body.	It is well to remark that if anyone holds that the soul is composed of matter and form, it would follow that in no way could the soul be the form of the body.
7956_245687_000028_000001	For since the form is an act, and matter is only in potentiality, that which is composed of matter and form cannot be the form of another by virtue of itself as a whole.	For since the form is an act, and matter is only in potentiality, that which is composed of matter and form cannot be the form of another by virtue of itself as a whole.
7956_245687_000029_000001	He proves this from the fact that "man and the sun generate man from matter." It is separate indeed according to its intellectual power, because the intellectual power does not belong to a corporeal organ, as the power of seeing is the act of the eye; for understanding is an act which cannot be performed by a corporeal organ, like the act of seeing.	He proves this from the fact that "man and the sun generate man from matter." It is separate indeed according to its intellectual power, because the intellectual power does not belong to a corporeal organ, as the power of seeing is the act of the eye; for understanding is an act which cannot be performed by a corporeal organ, like the act of seeing.
7956_245687_000030_000000	From this it is clear how to answer the Second and Third objections: since, in order that man may be able to understand all things by means of his intellect, and that his intellect may understand immaterial things and universals, it is sufficient that the intellectual power be not the act of the body.	From this it is clear how to answer the Second and Third objections: since, in order that man may be able to understand all things by means of his intellect, and that his intellect may understand immaterial things and universals, it is sufficient that the intellectual power be not the act of the body.
7956_245687_000031_000001	Therefore there is nothing to prevent some power thereof not being the act of the body, although the soul is essentially the form of the body.	Therefore there is nothing to prevent some power thereof not being the act of the body, although the soul is essentially the form of the body.
7956_245687_000032_000001	This is not the case with other non-subsistent forms.	This is not the case with other non subsistent forms.
7956_245687_000032_000002	For this reason the human soul retains its own existence after the dissolution of the body; whereas it is not so with other forms.	For this reason the human soul retains its own existence after the dissolution of the body; whereas it is not so with other forms.
7956_245687_000035_000000	Whether the Intellectual Principle Is Multiplied According to the Number of Bodies?	Whether the Intellectual Principle Is Multiplied According to the Number of Bodies?
7956_245687_000036_000001	For an immaterial substance is not multiplied in number within one species.	For an immaterial substance is not multiplied in number within one species.
7956_245687_000036_000003	Therefore there are not many human souls in one species.	Therefore there are not many human souls in one species.
7956_245687_000036_000004	But all men are of one species.	But all men are of one species.
7956_245687_000036_000005	Therefore there is but one intellect in all men.	Therefore there is but one intellect in all men.
7956_245687_000037_000002	This is heretical; for it would do away with the distinction of rewards and punishments.	This is heretical; for it would do away with the distinction of rewards and punishments.
7956_245687_000038_000001	Now whatever is received into anything must be received according to the condition of the receiver.	Now whatever is received into anything must be received according to the condition of the receiver.
7956_245687_000038_000002	Therefore the species of things would be received individually into my intellect, and also into yours: which is contrary to the nature of the intellect which knows universals.	Therefore the species of things would be received individually into my intellect, and also into yours: which is contrary to the nature of the intellect which knows universals.
7956_245687_000039_000001	If, therefore, my intellect is distinct from yours, what is understood by me must be distinct from what is understood by you; and consequently it will be reckoned as something individual, and be only potentially something understood; so that the common intention will have to be abstracted from both; since from things diverse something intelligible common to them may be abstracted.	If, therefore, my intellect is distinct from yours, what is understood by me must be distinct from what is understood by you; and consequently it will be reckoned as something individual, and be only potentially something understood; so that the common intention will have to be abstracted from both; since from things diverse something intelligible common to them may be abstracted.
7956_245687_000039_000002	But this is contrary to the nature of the intellect; for then the intellect would seem not to be distinct from the imagination.	But this is contrary to the nature of the intellect; for then the intellect would seem not to be distinct from the imagination.
7956_245687_000039_000003	It seems, therefore, to follow that there is one intellect in all men.	It seems, therefore, to follow that there is one intellect in all men.
7956_245687_000040_000001	It seems, therefore, that the same individual knowledge which is in the master is communicated to the disciple; which cannot be, unless there is one intellect in both.	It seems, therefore, that the same individual knowledge which is in the master is communicated to the disciple; which cannot be, unless there is one intellect in both.
7956_245687_000040_000002	Seemingly, therefore, the intellect of the disciple and master is but one; and, consequently, the same applies to all men.	Seemingly, therefore, the intellect of the disciple and master is but one; and, consequently, the same applies to all men.
7956_245687_000042_000001	But it is impossible that a soul, one in species, should belong to animals of different species. Therefore it is impossible that one individual intellectual soul should belong to several individuals.	But it is impossible that a soul, one in species, should belong to animals of different species. Therefore it is impossible that one individual intellectual soul should belong to several individuals.
7956_245687_000043_000001	This is clear if, as Plato maintained, man is the intellect itself.	This is clear if, as Plato maintained, man is the intellect itself.
7956_245687_000043_000002	For it would follow that Socrates and Plato are one man; and that they are not distinct from each other, except by something outside the essence of each.	For it would follow that Socrates and Plato are one man; and that they are not distinct from each other, except by something outside the essence of each.
7956_245687_000043_000003	The distinction between Socrates and Plato would be no other than that of one man with a tunic and another with a cloak; which is quite absurd.	The distinction between Socrates and Plato would be no other than that of one man with a tunic and another with a cloak; which is quite absurd.
7956_245687_000045_000000	Again, this is clearly impossible, whatever one may hold as to the manner of the union of the intellect to this or that man.	Again, this is clearly impossible, whatever one may hold as to the manner of the union of the intellect to this or that man.
7956_245687_000045_000001	For it is manifest that, supposing there is one principal agent, and two instruments, we can say that there is one agent absolutely, but several actions; as when one man touches several things with his two hands, there will be one who touches, but two contacts.	For it is manifest that, supposing there is one principal agent, and two instruments, we can say that there is one agent absolutely, but several actions; as when one man touches several things with his two hands, there will be one who touches, but two contacts.
7956_245687_000045_000002	If, on the contrary, we suppose one instrument and several principal agents, we might say that there are several agents, but one act; for example, if there be many drawing a ship by means of a rope; there will be many drawing, but one pull.	If, on the contrary, we suppose one instrument and several principal agents, we might say that there are several agents, but one act; for example, if there be many drawing a ship by means of a rope; there will be many drawing, but one pull.
7956_245687_000045_000003	If, however, there is one principal agent, and one instrument, we say that there is one agent and one action, as when the smith strikes with one hammer, there is one striker and one stroke.	If, however, there is one principal agent, and one instrument, we say that there is one agent and one action, as when the smith strikes with one hammer, there is one striker and one stroke.
7956_245687_000045_000005	Therefore, if we suppose two men to have several intellects and one sense--for instance, if two men had one eye--there would be several seers, but one sight.	Therefore, if we suppose two men to have several intellects and one sense-for instance, if two men had one eye-there would be several seers, but one sight.
7956_245687_000045_000006	But if there is one intellect, no matter how diverse may be all those things of which the intellect makes use as instruments, in no way is it possible to say that Socrates and Plato are otherwise than one understanding man.	But if there is one intellect, no matter how diverse may be all those things of which the intellect makes use as instruments, in no way is it possible to say that Socrates and Plato are otherwise than one understanding man.
7956_245687_000045_000007	And if to this we add that to understand, which is the act of the intellect, is not affected by any organ other than the intellect itself; it will further follow that there is but one agent and one action: that is to say that all men are but one "understander," and have but one act of understanding, in regard, that is, of one intelligible object.	And if to this we add that to understand, which is the act of the intellect, is not affected by any organ other than the intellect itself; it will further follow that there is but one agent and one action: that is to say that all men are but one "understander," and have but one act of understanding, in regard, that is, of one intelligible object.
7956_245687_000046_000001	But the phantasm itself is not a form of the possible intellect; it is the intelligible species abstracted from the phantasm that is a form.	But the phantasm itself is not a form of the possible intellect; it is the intelligible species abstracted from the phantasm that is a form.
7956_245687_000046_000003	Therefore, if there were one intellect for all men, the diversity of phantasms which are in this one and that one would not cause a diversity of intellectual operation in this man and that man.	Therefore, if there were one intellect for all men, the diversity of phantasms which are in this one and that one would not cause a diversity of intellectual operation in this man and that man.
7956_245687_000046_000004	It follows, therefore, that it is altogether impossible and unreasonable to maintain that there exists one intellect for all men.	It follows, therefore, that it is altogether impossible and unreasonable to maintain that there exists one intellect for all men.
7956_245687_000049_000001	But the materiality of the knower, and of the species whereby it knows, impedes the knowledge of the universal.	But the materiality of the knower, and of the species whereby it knows, impedes the knowledge of the universal.
7956_245687_000049_000003	But if the species be abstracted from the conditions of individual matter, there will be a likeness of the nature without those things which make it distinct and multiplied; thus there will be knowledge of the universal.	But if the species be abstracted from the conditions of individual matter, there will be a likeness of the nature without those things which make it distinct and multiplied; thus there will be knowledge of the universal.
7956_245687_000050_000001	Yet it is the stone which is understood, not the likeness of the stone; except by a reflection of the intellect on itself: otherwise, the objects of sciences would not be things, but only intelligible species.	Yet it is the stone which is understood, not the likeness of the stone; except by a reflection of the intellect on itself: otherwise, the objects of sciences would not be things, but only intelligible species.
7956_245687_000050_000003	And since knowledge is begotten according to the assimilation of the knower to the thing known, it follows that the same thing may happen to be known by several knowers; as is apparent in regard to the senses; for several see the same color, according to different likenesses.	And since knowledge is begotten according to the assimilation of the knower to the thing known, it follows that the same thing may happen to be known by several knowers; as is apparent in regard to the senses; for several see the same color, according to different likenesses.
7956_245687_000050_000006	For the common nature is understood as apart from the individuating principles; whereas such is not its mode of existence outside the soul.	For the common nature is understood as apart from the individuating principles; whereas such is not its mode of existence outside the soul.
7956_245687_000050_000007	But, according to the opinion of Plato, the thing understood exists outside the soul in the same condition as those under which it is understood; for he supposed that the natures of things exist separate from matter.	But, according to the opinion of Plato, the thing understood exists outside the soul in the same condition as those under which it is understood; for he supposed that the natures of things exist separate from matter.
7956_245687_000054_000000	Whether Besides the Intellectual Soul There Are in Man Other Souls Essentially Different from One Another?	Whether Besides the Intellectual Soul There Are in Man Other Souls Essentially Different from One Another?
7956_245687_000055_000000	Objection 1: It would seem that besides the intellectual soul there are in man other souls essentially different from one another, such as the sensitive soul and the nutritive soul.	Objection one: It would seem that besides the intellectual soul there are in man other souls essentially different from one another, such as the sensitive soul and the nutritive soul.
7956_245687_000055_000001	For corruptible and incorruptible are not of the same substance.	For corruptible and incorruptible are not of the same substance.
7956_245687_000056_000001	But the sensitive soul in the horse, the lion, and other brute animals, is corruptible.	But the sensitive soul in the horse, the lion, and other brute animals, is corruptible.
7956_245687_000057_000001	But "rational," which is the difference constituting man, is taken from the intellectual soul; while he is called "animal" by reason of his having a body animated by a sensitive soul.	But "rational," which is the difference constituting man, is taken from the intellectual soul; while he is called "animal" by reason of his having a body animated by a sensitive soul.
7956_245687_000057_000002	Therefore the intellectual soul may be compared to the body animated by a sensitive soul, as form to matter.	Therefore the intellectual soul may be compared to the body animated by a sensitive soul, as form to matter.

7956_245687_000059_000001	Now this would not be the case if the various principles of the soul's operations were essentially different, and distributed in the various parts of the body.

7956_245687_000059_000002	But with regard to the intellectual part, he seems to leave it in doubt whether it be "only logically" distinct from the other parts of the soul, "or also locally."	But with regard to the intellectual part, he seems to leave it in doubt whether it be "only logically" distinct from the other parts of the soul, "or also locally."
7956_245687_000060_000001	If we suppose, however, that the soul is united to the body as its form, it is quite impossible for several essentially different souls to be in one body.	If we suppose, however, that the soul is united to the body as its form, it is quite impossible for several essentially different souls to be in one body.
7956_245687_000060_000002	This can be made clear by three different reasons.	This can be made clear by three different reasons.
7956_245687_000061_000000	In the first place, an animal would not be absolutely one, in which there were several souls.	In the first place, an animal would not be absolutely one, in which there were several souls.
7956_245687_000061_000004	It cannot be said that they are united by the one body; because rather does the soul contain the body and make it one, than the reverse.	It cannot be said that they are united by the one body; because rather does the soul contain the body and make it one, than the reverse.
7956_245687_000062_000000	Secondly, this is proved to be impossible by the manner in which one thing is predicated of another.	Secondly, this is proved to be impossible by the manner in which one thing is predicated of another.
7956_245687_000062_000002	But both of these consequences are clearly false: because "animal" is predicated of man essentially and not accidentally; and man is not part of the definition of an animal, but the other way about. Therefore of necessity by the same form a thing is animal and man; otherwise man would not really be the thing which is an animal, so that animal can be essentially predicated of man.	But both of these consequences are clearly false: because "animal" is predicated of man essentially and not accidentally; and man is not part of the definition of an animal, but the other way about. Therefore of necessity by the same form a thing is animal and man; otherwise man would not really be the thing which is an animal, so that animal can be essentially predicated of man.
7956_245687_000063_000000	Thirdly, this is shown to be impossible by the fact that when one operation of the soul is intense it impedes another, which could never be the case unless the principle of action were essentially one.	Thirdly, this is shown to be impossible by the fact that when one operation of the soul is intense it impedes another, which could never be the case unless the principle of action were essentially one.
7956_245687_000064_000000	We must therefore conclude that in man the sensitive soul, the intellectual soul, and the nutritive soul are numerically one soul. This can easily be explained, if we consider the differences of species and forms.	We must therefore conclude that in man the sensitive soul, the intellectual soul, and the nutritive soul are numerically one soul. This can easily be explained, if we consider the differences of species and forms.
7956_245687_000064_000001	For we observe that the species and forms of things differ from one another, as the perfect and imperfect; as in the order of things, the animate are more perfect than the inanimate, and animals more perfect than plants, and man than brute animals; and in each of these genera there are various degrees.	For we observe that the species and forms of things differ from one another, as the perfect and imperfect; as in the order of things, the animate are more perfect than the inanimate, and animals more perfect than plants, and man than brute animals; and in each of these genera there are various degrees.
7956_245687_000064_000004	Thus the intellectual soul contains virtually whatever belongs to the sensitive soul of brute animals, and to the nutritive souls of plants.	Thus the intellectual soul contains virtually whatever belongs to the sensitive soul of brute animals, and to the nutritive souls of plants.
7956_245687_000064_000005	Therefore, as a surface which is of a pentagonal shape, is not tetragonal by one shape, and pentagonal by another--since a tetragonal shape would be superfluous as contained in the pentagonal--so neither is Socrates a man by one soul, and animal by another; but by one and the same soul he is both animal and man.	Therefore, as a surface which is of a pentagonal shape, is not tetragonal by one shape, and pentagonal by another-since a tetragonal shape would be superfluous as contained in the pentagonal-so neither is Socrates a man by one soul, and animal by another; but by one and the same soul he is both animal and man.
7956_245687_000065_000001	When, therefore, a soul is sensitive only, it is corruptible; but when with sensibility it has also intellectuality, it is incorruptible.	When, therefore, a soul is sensitive only, it is corruptible; but when with sensibility it has also intellectuality, it is incorruptible.
7956_245687_000065_000002	For although sensibility does not give incorruptibility, yet it cannot deprive intellectuality of its incorruptibility.	For although sensibility does not give incorruptibility, yet it cannot deprive intellectuality of its incorruptibility.
7956_245687_000066_000001	Now man is corruptible like other animals.	Now man is corruptible like other animals.
7956_245687_000066_000002	And so the difference of corruptible and incorruptible which is on the part of the forms does not involve a generic difference between man and the other animals.	And so the difference of corruptible and incorruptible which is on the part of the forms does not involve a generic difference between man and the other animals.
7956_245687_000068_000001	Therefore since, as we have said, the intellectual soul contains virtually what belongs to the sensitive soul, and something more, reason can consider separately what belongs to the power of the sensitive soul, as something imperfect and material.	Therefore since, as we have said, the intellectual soul contains virtually what belongs to the sensitive soul, and something more, reason can consider separately what belongs to the power of the sensitive soul, as something imperfect and material.
