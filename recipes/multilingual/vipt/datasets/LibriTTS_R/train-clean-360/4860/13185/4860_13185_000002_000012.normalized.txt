Next day the masthead of their boat was seen sticking out of the water near Sunday Island. The pilot schooner went down and hauled the boat to the surface, but nothing was found in her except the sand ballast and a bottle of rum. Her sheet was made fast, and when the squall struck her she had gone down like a stone.
