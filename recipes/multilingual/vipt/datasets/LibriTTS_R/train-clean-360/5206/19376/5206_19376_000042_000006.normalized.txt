We are here only about one hundred fifty feet above the level of the sea; hence, the tide would sweep right over us and rush far away inland. At high tide we should have some two hundred feet of blue water over our heads. There would be nothing to stop such a tide as that in this neighbourhood till it reached the high lands of Derbyshire.
