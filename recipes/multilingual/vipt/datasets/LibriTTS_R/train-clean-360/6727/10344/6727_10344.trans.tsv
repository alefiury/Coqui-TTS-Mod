6727_10344_000013_000002	But such names are used in their proper sense in spiritual things.	But such names are used in their proper sense in spiritual things.
6727_10344_000013_000003	Therefore light is used in its proper sense in spiritual matters.	Therefore light is used in its proper sense in spiritual matters.
6727_10344_000014_000001	Therefore also does light.	Therefore also does light.
6727_10344_000016_000003	And thus it is with the word light.	And thus it is with the word light.
6727_10344_000016_000004	In its primary meaning it signifies that which makes manifest to the sense of sight; afterwards it was extended to that which makes manifest to cognition of any kind.	In its primary meaning it signifies that which makes manifest to the sense of sight; afterwards it was extended to that which makes manifest to cognition of any kind.
6727_10344_000016_000006	But if taken in its common and extended use, as applied to manifestation of every kind, it may properly be applied to spiritual things.	But if taken in its common and extended use, as applied to manifestation of every kind, it may properly be applied to spiritual things.
6727_10344_000019_000000	Whether Light Is a Body?	Whether Light Is a Body?

6727_10344_000023_000001	But this is the case with light and air.	But this is the case with light and air.
6727_10344_000023_000002	Therefore light is not a body.	Therefore light is not a body.
6727_10344_000024_000001	For the place of any one body is different from that of any other, nor is it possible, naturally speaking, for any two bodies of whatever nature, to exist simultaneously in the same place; since contiguity requires distinction of place.	For the place of any one body is different from that of any other, nor is it possible, naturally speaking, for any two bodies of whatever nature, to exist simultaneously in the same place; since contiguity requires distinction of place.
6727_10344_000025_000000	The second reason is from movement.	The second reason is from movement.
6727_10344_000025_000001	For if light were a body, its diffusion would be the local movement of a body.	For if light were a body, its diffusion would be the local movement of a body.
6727_10344_000025_000002	Now no local movement of a body can be instantaneous, as everything that moves from one place to another must pass through the intervening space before reaching the end: whereas the diffusion of light is instantaneous.	Now no local movement of a body can be instantaneous, as everything that moves from one place to another must pass through the intervening space before reaching the end: whereas the diffusion of light is instantaneous.
6727_10344_000025_000004	Yet as soon as the sun is at the horizon, the whole hemisphere is illuminated from end to end.	Yet as soon as the sun is at the horizon, the whole hemisphere is illuminated from end to end.
6727_10344_000025_000005	It must also be borne in mind on the part of movement that whereas all bodies have their natural determinate movement, that of light is indifferent as regards direction, working equally in a circle as in a straight line.	It must also be borne in mind on the part of movement that whereas all bodies have their natural determinate movement, that of light is indifferent as regards direction, working equally in a circle as in a straight line.
6727_10344_000025_000006	Hence it appears that the diffusion of light is not the local movement of a body.	Hence it appears that the diffusion of light is not the local movement of a body.
6727_10344_000026_000000	The third reason is from generation and corruption.	The third reason is from generation and corruption.
6727_10344_000026_000001	For if light were a body, it would follow that whenever the air is darkened by the absence of the luminary, the body of light would be corrupted, and its matter would receive a new form.	For if light were a body, it would follow that whenever the air is darkened by the absence of the luminary, the body of light would be corrupted, and its matter would receive a new form.
6727_10344_000026_000002	But unless we are to say that darkness is a body, this does not appear to be the case.	But unless we are to say that darkness is a body, this does not appear to be the case.
6727_10344_000026_000003	Neither does it appear from what matter a body can be daily generated large enough to fill the intervening hemisphere.	Neither does it appear from what matter a body can be daily generated large enough to fill the intervening hemisphere.
6727_10344_000026_000004	Also it would be absurd to say that a body of so great a bulk is corrupted by the mere absence of the luminary.	Also it would be absurd to say that a body of so great a bulk is corrupted by the mere absence of the luminary.
6727_10344_000027_000000	Since, therefore, these things are repugnant, not only to reason, but to common sense, we must conclude that light cannot be a body.	Since, therefore, these things are repugnant, not only to reason, but to common sense, we must conclude that light cannot be a body.
6727_10344_000030_000002	55, we use terms belonging to local movement in speaking of alteration and movement of all kinds.	fifty five, we use terms belonging to local movement in speaking of alteration and movement of all kinds.

6727_10344_000034_000001	But this is not the case with light since darkness is merely a privation of light.	But this is not the case with light since darkness is merely a privation of light.
6727_10344_000034_000002	Light therefore is not a sensible quality.	Light therefore is not a sensible quality.
6727_10344_000035_000001	But the light of the heavenly bodies is a cause of substantial forms of earthly bodies, and also gives to colors their immaterial being, by making them actually visible.	But the light of the heavenly bodies is a cause of substantial forms of earthly bodies, and also gives to colors their immaterial being, by making them actually visible.
6727_10344_000035_000002	Light, then, is not a sensible quality, but rather a substantial or spiritual form.	Light, then, is not a sensible quality, but rather a substantial or spiritual form.
6727_10344_000037_000001	But this cannot be the case for two reasons.	But this cannot be the case for two reasons.

6727_10344_000037_000003	But color does not do this, for we do not speak of the air as colored.	But color does not do this, for we do not speak of the air as colored.
6727_10344_000037_000004	Secondly, because light produces natural effects, for by the rays of the sun bodies are warmed, and natural changes cannot be brought about by mere intentions.	Secondly, because light produces natural effects, for by the rays of the sun bodies are warmed, and natural changes cannot be brought about by mere intentions.
6727_10344_000037_000005	Others have said that light is the sun's substantial form, but this also seems impossible for two reasons.	Others have said that light is the sun's substantial form, but this also seems impossible for two reasons.
6727_10344_000037_000007	In the second place, because it is impossible that what is the substantial form of one thing should be the accidental form of another; since substantial forms of their very nature constitute species: wherefore the substantial form always and everywhere accompanies the species.	In the second place, because it is impossible that what is the substantial form of one thing should be the accidental form of another; since substantial forms of their very nature constitute species: wherefore the substantial form always and everywhere accompanies the species.
6727_10344_000037_000008	But light is not the substantial form of air, for if it were, the air would be destroyed when light is withdrawn.	But light is not the substantial form of air, for if it were, the air would be destroyed when light is withdrawn.
6727_10344_000037_000009	Hence it cannot be the substantial form of the sun.	Hence it cannot be the substantial form of the sun
6727_10344_000038_000001	A proof of this is that the rays of different stars produce different effects according to the diverse natures of bodies.	A proof of this is that the rays of different stars produce different effects according to the diverse natures of bodies.
6727_10344_000039_000001	For when matter receives its form perfectly, the qualities consequent upon the form are firm and enduring; as when, for instance, water is converted into fire.	For when matter receives its form perfectly, the qualities consequent upon the form are firm and enduring; as when, for instance, water is converted into fire.
6727_10344_000039_000002	When, however, substantial form is received imperfectly, so as to be, as it were, in process of being received, rather than fully impressed, the consequent quality lasts for a time but is not permanent; as may be seen when water which has been heated returns in time to its natural state.	When, however, substantial form is received imperfectly, so as to be, as it were, in process of being received, rather than fully impressed, the consequent quality lasts for a time but is not permanent; as may be seen when water which has been heated returns in time to its natural state.
6727_10344_000039_000003	But light is not produced by the transmutation of matter, as though matter were in receipt of a substantial form, and light were a certain inception of substantial form.	But light is not produced by the transmutation of matter, as though matter were in receipt of a substantial form, and light were a certain inception of substantial form.

6727_10344_000044_000002	But qualities are accidents, and as such should have, not the first, but a subordinate place.	But qualities are accidents, and as such should have, not the first, but a subordinate place.
6727_10344_000044_000003	The production of light, then, ought not to be assigned to the first day.	The production of light, then, ought not to be assigned to the first day.
6727_10344_000045_000001	Therefore the production of light could not have been on the first day.	Therefore the production of light could not have been on the first day.
6727_10344_000046_000001	But movement of this kind is an attribute of the firmament, and we read that the firmament was made on the second day.	But movement of this kind is an attribute of the firmament, and we read that the firmament was made on the second day.

6727_10344_000052_000008	It was fitting, then, as an evidence of the Divine wisdom, that among the works of distinction the production of light should take first place, since light is a form of the primary body, and because it is more common quality.	It was fitting, then, as an evidence of the Divine wisdom, that among the works of distinction the production of light should take first place, since light is a form of the primary body, and because it is more common quality.
6727_10344_000053_000001	And there is yet a fourth, already touched upon in the objections; that day cannot be unless light exists, which was made therefore on the first day.	And there is yet a fourth, already touched upon in the objections; that day cannot be unless light exists, which was made therefore on the first day.
6727_10344_000055_000001	But this cannot well be maintained, as in the beginning of Genesis Holy Scripture records the institution of that order of nature which henceforth is to endure.	But this cannot well be maintained, as in the beginning of genesis Holy Scripture records the institution of that order of nature which henceforth is to endure.
