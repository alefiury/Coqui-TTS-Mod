716_129583_000001_000001	I followed the llama up the beach, and was overtaken by Montgomery, who asked me not to enter the stone enclosure. I noticed then that the puma in its cage and the pile of packages had been placed outside the entrance to this quadrangle.

716_129583_000004_000000	"He knows something of science," said Montgomery.	"He knows something of science," said Montgomery.
716_129583_000005_000000	"I'm itching to get to work again--with this new stuff," said the white-haired man, nodding towards the enclosure. His eyes grew brighter.

716_129583_000007_000000	"We can't send him over there, and we can't spare the time to build him a new shanty; and we certainly can't take him into our confidence just yet."	"We can't send him over there, and we can't spare the time to build him a new shanty; and we certainly can't take him into our confidence just yet."

716_129583_000009_000000	"I've been thinking of the same things," Montgomery answered. "There's my room with the outer door--"	"I've been thinking of the same things," Montgomery answered. "There's my room with the outer door-"
716_129583_000010_000000	"That's it," said the elder man, promptly, looking at Montgomery; and all three of us went towards the enclosure.	"That's it," said the elder man, promptly, looking at Montgomery; and all three of us went towards the enclosure.
716_129583_000010_000001	"I'm sorry to make a mystery, Mr. Prendick; but you'll remember you're uninvited. Our little establishment here contains a secret or so, is a kind of Blue-Beard's chamber, in fact.	"I'm sorry to make a mystery, mr Prendick; but you'll remember you're uninvited.

716_129583_000012_000002	I followed him, and found myself in a small apartment, plainly but not uncomfortably furnished and with its inner door, which was slightly ajar, opening into a paved courtyard.

716_129583_000012_000003	This inner door Montgomery at once closed. A hammock was slung across the darker corner of the room, and a small unglazed window defended by an iron bar looked out towards the sea.	This inner door Montgomery at once closed.

716_129583_000014_000001	"Moreau!" I heard him call, and for the moment I do not think I noticed.

716_129583_000016_000001	From that my thoughts went to the indefinable queerness of the deformed man on the beach. I never saw such a gait, such odd motions as he pulled at the box. I recalled that none of these men had spoken to me, though most of them I had found looking at me at one time or another in a peculiarly furtive manner, quite unlike the frank stare of your unsophisticated savage.

716_129583_000019_000005	The phrase drifted loose in my mind for a moment, and then I saw it in red lettering on a little buff-coloured pamphlet, to read which made one shiver and creep.

716_129583_000019_000006	That long-forgotten pamphlet came back with startling vividness to my mind. I had been a mere lad then, and Moreau was, I suppose, about fifty,--a prominent and masterful physiologist, well-known in scientific circles for his extraordinary imagination and his brutal directness in discussion.

716_129583_000020_000004	The doctor was simply howled out of the country. It may be that he deserved to be; but I still think that the tepid support of his fellow-investigators and his desertion by the great body of scientific workers was a shameful thing.

716_129583_000020_000005	Yet some of his experiments, by the journalist's account, were wantonly cruel. He might perhaps have purchased his social peace by abandoning his investigations; but he apparently preferred the latter, as most men would who have once fallen under the overmastering spell of research. He was unmarried, and had indeed nothing but his own interest to consider.	Yet some of his experiments, by the journalist's account, were wantonly cruel.
