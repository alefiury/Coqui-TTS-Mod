Well boiled greens-or mangel wurzel boiled to a jelly-are an excellent addition to the food of all dogs, and may be given twice a week; but they ought to be discontinued during the shooting season with pointers, setters, cockers, and greyhounds; and also during the hunting season with foxhounds, harriers, and beagles, as they are apt to render the bowels too open for hard work.
