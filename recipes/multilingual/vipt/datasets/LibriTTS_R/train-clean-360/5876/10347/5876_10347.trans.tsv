5876_10347_000008_000000	Objection 1: It would seem that the lights ought not to have been produced on the fourth day.	Objection one: It would seem that the lights ought not to have been produced on the fourth day.
5876_10347_000008_000001	For the heavenly luminaries are by nature incorruptible bodies: wherefore their matter cannot exist without their form.	For the heavenly luminaries are by nature incorruptible bodies: wherefore their matter cannot exist without their form.
5876_10347_000008_000002	But as their matter was produced in the work of creation, before there was any day, so therefore were their forms.	But as their matter was produced in the work of creation, before there was any day, so therefore were their forms.
5876_10347_000008_000003	It follows, then, that the lights were not produced on the fourth day.	It follows, then, that the lights were not produced on the fourth day.
5876_10347_000010_000001	For, the Scripture says: "He set them in the firmament." But plants are described as produced when the earth, to which they are attached, received its form.	For, the Scripture says: "He set them in the firmament." But plants are described as produced when the earth, to which they are attached, received its form.
5876_10347_000011_000001	Now, cause precedes effect in the order of nature. The lights, therefore, ought not to have been produced on the fourth day, but on the third day.	Now, cause precedes effect in the order of nature. The lights, therefore, ought not to have been produced on the fourth day, but on the third day.
5876_10347_000012_000001	Therefore the sun and the moon alone are not correctly described as the "two great lights."	Therefore the sun and the moon alone are not correctly described as the "two great lights."
5876_10347_000014_000004	For the perfection of the heaven and the earth regards, seemingly, those things that belong to them intrinsically, but the adornment, those that are extrinsic, just as the perfection of a man lies in his proper parts and forms, and his adornment, in clothing or such like.

5876_10347_000014_000005	Now just as distinction of certain things is made most evident by their local movement, as separating one from another; so the work of adornment is set forth by the production of things having movement in the heavens, and upon the earth.	Now just as distinction of certain things is made most evident by their local movement, as separating one from another; so the work of adornment is set forth by the production of things having movement in the heavens, and upon the earth.

5876_10347_000015_000001	For those, however, who hold the heavenly bodies to be of another nature from the elements, and naturally incorruptible, the answer must be that the lights were substantially created at the beginning, but that their substance, at first formless, is formed on this day, by receiving not its substantial form, but a determination of power.	For those, however, who hold the heavenly bodies to be of another nature from the elements, and naturally incorruptible, the answer must be that the lights were substantially created at the beginning, but that their substance, at first formless, is formed on this day, by receiving not its substantial form, but a determination of power.

5876_10347_000043_000000	In examining the truth of this question, where such diversity of opinion exists, we shall do well to bear in mind that the union of soul and body exists for the sake of the soul and not of the body; for the form does not exist for the matter, but the matter for the form.	In examining the truth of this question, where such diversity of opinion exists, we shall do well to bear in mind that the union of soul and body exists for the sake of the soul and not of the body; for the form does not exist for the matter, but the matter for the form.

There are, however, operations of the soul, which are not exercised through the medium of the body, though the body ministers, as it were, to their production.
5876_10347_000043_000006	It is not, however, possible that the functions of nutrition, growth, and generation, through which the nutritive soul operates, can be exercised by the heavenly bodies, for such operations are incompatible with a body naturally incorruptible.	It is not, however, possible that the functions of nutrition, growth, and generation, through which the nutritive soul operates, can be exercised by the heavenly bodies, for such operations are incompatible with a body naturally incorruptible.
5876_10347_000043_000008	It follows, then, that of the operations of the soul the only ones left to be attributed to the heavenly bodies are those of understanding and moving; for appetite follows both sensitive and intellectual perception, and is in proportion thereto.	It follows, then, that of the operations of the soul the only ones left to be attributed to the heavenly bodies are those of understanding and moving; for appetite follows both sensitive and intellectual perception, and is in proportion thereto.

5876_10347_000043_000015	The Platonists explain the union of soul and body in the same way, as a contact of a moving power with the object moved, and since Plato holds the heavenly bodies to be living beings, this means nothing else but that substances of spiritual nature are united to them, and act as their moving power.	The Platonists explain the union of soul and body in the same way, as a contact of a moving power with the object moved, and since Plato holds the heavenly bodies to be living beings, this means nothing else but that substances of spiritual nature are united to them, and act as their moving power.
5876_10347_000043_000016	A proof that the heavenly bodies are moved by the direct influence and contact of some spiritual substance, and not, like bodies of specific gravity, by nature, lies in the fact that whereas nature moves to one fixed end which having attained, it rests; this does not appear in the movement of heavenly bodies.	A proof that the heavenly bodies are moved by the direct influence and contact of some spiritual substance, and not, like bodies of specific gravity, by nature, lies in the fact that whereas nature moves to one fixed end which having attained, it rests; this does not appear in the movement of heavenly bodies.
5876_10347_000043_000017	Hence it follows that they are moved by some intellectual substances.	Hence it follows that they are moved by some intellectual substances.
5876_10347_000044_000000	From what has been said, then, it is clear that the heavenly bodies are not living beings in the same sense as plants and animals, and that if they are called so, it can only be equivocally.	From what has been said, then, it is clear that the heavenly bodies are not living beings in the same sense as plants and animals, and that if they are called so, it can only be equivocally.

5876_10347_000046_000001	While, then, it is not conceded that the souls of heavenly bodies are nobler than the souls of animals absolutely it must be conceded that they are superior to them with regard to their respective forms, since their form perfects their matter entirely, which is not in potentiality to other forms; whereas a soul does not do this.
