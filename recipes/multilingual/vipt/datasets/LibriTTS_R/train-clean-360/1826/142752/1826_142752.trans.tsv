1826_142752_000001_000002	There can be no doubt that the hope of finding reason to believe such theses as these has been the chief inspiration of many life-long students of philosophy.

1826_142752_000001_000005	In this chapter we shall briefly consider the kind of way in which such reasoning is attempted, with a view to discovering whether we can hope that it may be valid.

Just as a comparative anatomist, from a single bone, sees what kind of animal the whole must have been, so the metaphysician, according to Hegel, sees, from any one piece of reality, what the whole of reality must be-at least in its large outlines.
1826_142752_000002_000003	Every apparently separate piece of reality has, as it were, hooks which grapple it to the next piece; the next piece, in turn, has fresh hooks, and so on, until the whole universe is reconstructed.	Every apparently separate piece of reality has, as it were, hooks which grapple it to the next piece; the next piece, in turn, has fresh hooks, and so on, until the whole universe is reconstructed.
1826_142752_000002_000007	In this way Hegel advances until he reaches the 'Absolute Idea', which, according to him, has no incompleteness, no opposite, and no need of further development.	In this way Hegel advances until he reaches the 'Absolute Idea', which, according to him, has no incompleteness, no opposite, and no need of further development.
1826_142752_000002_000008	The Absolute Idea, therefore, is adequate to describe Absolute Reality; but all lower ideas only describe reality as it appears to a partial view, not as it is to one who simultaneously surveys the Whole.	The Absolute Idea, therefore, is adequate to describe Absolute Reality; but all lower ideas only describe reality as it appears to a partial view, not as it is to one who simultaneously surveys the Whole.
1826_142752_000002_000009	Thus Hegel reaches the conclusion that Absolute Reality forms one single harmonious system, not in space or time, not in any degree evil, wholly rational, and wholly spiritual.	Thus Hegel reaches the conclusion that Absolute Reality forms one single harmonious system, not in space or time, not in any degree evil, wholly rational, and wholly spiritual.
1826_142752_000002_000010	Any appearance to the contrary, in the world we know, can be proved logically--so he believes--to be entirely due to our fragmentary piecemeal view of the universe.	Any appearance to the contrary, in the world we know, can be proved logically-so he believes-to be entirely due to our fragmentary piecemeal view of the universe.
1826_142752_000003_000000	In this conception, there is undeniably something sublime, something to which we could wish to yield assent.	In this conception, there is undeniably something sublime, something to which we could wish to yield assent.
1826_142752_000003_000001	Nevertheless, when the arguments in support of it are carefully examined, they appear to involve much confusion and many unwarrantable assumptions.	Nevertheless, when the arguments in support of it are carefully examined, they appear to involve much confusion and many unwarrantable assumptions.
1826_142752_000003_000002	The fundamental tenet upon which the system is built up is that what is incomplete must be not self-subsistent, but must need the support of other things before it can exist.	The fundamental tenet upon which the system is built up is that what is incomplete must be not self subsistent, but must need the support of other things before it can exist.
1826_142752_000003_000003	It is held that whatever has relations to things outside itself must contain some reference to those outside things in its own nature, and could not, therefore, be what it is if those outside things did not exist.	It is held that whatever has relations to things outside itself must contain some reference to those outside things in its own nature, and could not, therefore, be what it is if those outside things did not exist.
1826_142752_000004_000001	It is of course the case that a truth which connects one thing with another thing could not subsist if the other thing did not subsist.	It is of course the case that a truth which connects one thing with another thing could not subsist if the other thing did not subsist.
1826_142752_000004_000003	But if the word 'nature' is used in this sense, we shall have to hold that the thing may be known when its 'nature' is not known, or at any rate is not known completely.	But if the word 'nature' is used in this sense, we shall have to hold that the thing may be known when its 'nature' is not known, or at any rate is not known completely.
1826_142752_000004_000004	There is a confusion, when this use of the word 'nature' is employed, between knowledge of things and knowledge of truths.	There is a confusion, when this use of the word 'nature' is employed, between knowledge of things and knowledge of truths.
1826_142752_000004_000006	Thus, acquaintance with a thing does not involve knowledge of its 'nature' in the above sense.	Thus, acquaintance with a thing does not involve knowledge of its 'nature' in the above sense.
1826_142752_000004_000007	And although acquaintance with a thing is involved in our knowing any one proposition about a thing, knowledge of its 'nature', in the above sense, is not involved.	And although acquaintance with a thing is involved in our knowing any one proposition about a thing, knowledge of its 'nature', in the above sense, is not involved.
1826_142752_000004_000009	I may be acquainted, for example, with my toothache, and this knowledge may be as complete as knowledge by acquaintance ever can be, without knowing all that the dentist (who is not acquainted with it) can tell me about its cause, and without therefore knowing its 'nature' in the above sense.	I may be acquainted, for example, with my toothache, and this knowledge may be as complete as knowledge by acquaintance ever can be, without knowing all that the dentist (who is not acquainted with it) can tell me about its cause, and without therefore knowing its 'nature' in the above sense.
1826_142752_000005_000000	It follows that we cannot prove that the universe as a whole forms a single harmonious system such as Hegel believes that it forms.	It follows that we cannot prove that the universe as a whole forms a single harmonious system such as Hegel believes that it forms.
1826_142752_000005_000001	And if we cannot prove this, we also cannot prove the unreality of space and time and matter and evil, for this is deduced by Hegel from the fragmentary and relational character of these things.	And if we cannot prove this, we also cannot prove the unreality of space and time and matter and evil, for this is deduced by Hegel from the fragmentary and relational character of these things.
1826_142752_000006_000000	Most of the great ambitious attempts of metaphysicians have proceeded by the attempt to prove that such and such apparent features of the actual world were self-contradictory, and therefore could not be real.	Most of the great ambitious attempts of metaphysicians have proceeded by the attempt to prove that such and such apparent features of the actual world were self contradictory, and therefore could not be real.
1826_142752_000006_000002	A good illustration of this is afforded by space and time.	A good illustration of this is afforded by space and time.
1826_142752_000006_000003	Space and time appear to be infinite in extent, and infinitely divisible.	Space and time appear to be infinite in extent, and infinitely divisible.
1826_142752_000007_000001	In time, similarly, however little time may elapse between two moments, it seems evident that there will be other moments between them.	In time, similarly, however little time may elapse between two moments, it seems evident that there will be other moments between them.
1826_142752_000007_000002	Thus space and time appear to be infinitely divisible.	Thus space and time appear to be infinitely divisible.
1826_142752_000007_000003	But as against these apparent facts--infinite extent and infinite divisibility--philosophers have advanced arguments tending to show that there could be no infinite collections of things, and that therefore the number of points in space, or of instants in time, must be finite.	But as against these apparent facts-infinite extent and infinite divisibility-philosophers have advanced arguments tending to show that there could be no infinite collections of things, and that therefore the number of points in space, or of instants in time, must be finite.
1826_142752_000007_000004	Thus a contradiction emerged between the apparent nature of space and time and the supposed impossibility of infinite collections.	Thus a contradiction emerged between the apparent nature of space and time and the supposed impossibility of infinite collections.
1826_142752_000008_000000	Kant, who first emphasized this contradiction, deduced the impossibility of space and time, which he declared to be merely subjective; and since his time very many philosophers have believed that space and time are mere appearance, not characteristic of the world as it really is.	Kant, who first emphasized this contradiction, deduced the impossibility of space and time, which he declared to be merely subjective; and since his time very many philosophers have believed that space and time are mere appearance, not characteristic of the world as it really is.
1826_142752_000008_000001	Now, however, owing to the labours of the mathematicians, notably Georg Cantor, it has appeared that the impossibility of infinite collections was a mistake.

1826_142752_000009_000000	The mathematicians, however, have not been content with showing that space as it is commonly supposed to be is possible; they have shown also that many other forms of space are equally possible, so far as logic can show.	The mathematicians, however, have not been content with showing that space as it is commonly supposed to be is possible; they have shown also that many other forms of space are equally possible, so far as logic can show.
1826_142752_000009_000002	By imagining worlds in which these axioms are false, the mathematicians have used logic to loosen the prejudices of common sense, and to show the possibility of spaces differing--some more, some less--from that in which we live.	By imagining worlds in which these axioms are false, the mathematicians have used logic to loosen the prejudices of common sense, and to show the possibility of spaces differing-some more, some less-from that in which we live.
1826_142752_000009_000004	Formerly it appeared that experience left only one kind of space to logic, and logic showed this one kind to be impossible.	Formerly it appeared that experience left only one kind of space to logic, and logic showed this one kind to be impossible.
1826_142752_000009_000005	Now, logic presents many kinds of space as possible apart from experience, and experience only partially decides between them.	Now, logic presents many kinds of space as possible apart from experience, and experience only partially decides between them.
1826_142752_000009_000006	Thus, while our knowledge of what is has become less than it was formerly supposed to be, our knowledge of what may be is enormously increased.	Thus, while our knowledge of what is has become less than it was formerly supposed to be, our knowledge of what may be is enormously increased.
1826_142752_000010_000000	What has happened in the case of space and time has happened, to some extent, in other directions as well.	What has happened in the case of space and time has happened, to some extent, in other directions as well.
1826_142752_000010_000002	Thus knowledge as to what exists becomes limited to what we can learn from experience--not to what we can actually experience, for, as we have seen, there is much knowledge by description concerning things of which we have no direct experience.	Thus knowledge as to what exists becomes limited to what we can learn from experience-not to what we can actually experience, for, as we have seen, there is much knowledge by description concerning things of which we have no direct experience.
1826_142752_000012_000000	Philosophical knowledge, if what has been said above is true, does not differ essentially from scientific knowledge; there is no special source of wisdom which is open to philosophy but not to science, and the results obtained by philosophy are not radically different from those obtained from science.	Philosophical knowledge, if what has been said above is true, does not differ essentially from scientific knowledge; there is no special source of wisdom which is open to philosophy but not to science, and the results obtained by philosophy are not radically different from those obtained from science.
1826_142752_000012_000001	The essential characteristic of philosophy, which makes it a study distinct from science, is criticism.	The essential characteristic of philosophy, which makes it a study distinct from science, is criticism.
1826_142752_000013_000001	If we adopt the attitude of the complete sceptic, placing ourselves wholly outside all knowledge, and asking, from this outside position, to be compelled to return within the circle of knowledge, we are demanding what is impossible, and our scepticism can never be refuted.	If we adopt the attitude of the complete sceptic, placing ourselves wholly outside all knowledge, and asking, from this outside position, to be compelled to return within the circle of knowledge, we are demanding what is impossible, and our scepticism can never be refuted.
1826_142752_000013_000002	For all refutation must begin with some piece of knowledge which the disputants share; from blank doubt, no argument can begin.	For all refutation must begin with some piece of knowledge which the disputants share; from blank doubt, no argument can begin.
1826_142752_000013_000003	Hence the criticism of knowledge which philosophy employs must not be of this destructive kind, if any result is to be achieved.	Hence the criticism of knowledge which philosophy employs must not be of this destructive kind, if any result is to be achieved.
1826_142752_000013_000005	But it is not difficult to see that scepticism of this kind is unreasonable.	But it is not difficult to see that scepticism of this kind is unreasonable.
1826_142752_000013_000007	His 'methodical doubt' consisted in doubting whatever seemed doubtful; in pausing, with each apparent piece of knowledge, to ask himself whether, on reflection, he could feel certain that he really knew it.

1826_142752_000013_000011	But there are beliefs--such, for example, as the belief that physical objects exactly resemble our sense-data--which are entertained until we begin to reflect, but are found to melt away when subjected to a close inquiry.

1826_142752_000013_000012	Such beliefs philosophy will bid us reject, unless some new line of argument is found to support them. But to reject the beliefs which do not appear open to any objections, however closely we examine them, is not reasonable, and is not what philosophy advocates.

1826_142752_000014_000000	The criticism aimed at, in a word, is not that which, without reason, determines to reject, but that which considers each piece of apparent knowledge on its merits, and retains whatever still appears to be knowledge when this consideration is completed.
