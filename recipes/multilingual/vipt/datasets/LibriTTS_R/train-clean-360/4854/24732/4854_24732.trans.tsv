4854_24732_000004_000000	Corollary III.--It follows, thirdly, that God is the absolutely first cause.	Corollary three.--It follows, thirdly, that God is the absolutely first cause.

4854_24732_000009_000000	Note.--Others think that God is a free cause, because he can, as they think, bring it about, that those things which we have said follow from his nature--that is, which are in his power, should not come to pass, or should not be produced by him.	Note.--Others think that God is a free cause, because he can, as they think, bring it about, that those things which we have said follow from his nature-that is, which are in his power, should not come to pass, or should not be produced by him.
4854_24732_000009_000001	But this is the same as if they said, that God could bring it about, that it should follow from the nature of a triangle that its three interior angles should not be equal to two right angles; or that from a given cause no effect should follow, which is absurd.	But this is the same as if they said, that God could bring it about, that it should follow from the nature of a triangle that its three interior angles should not be equal to two right angles; or that from a given cause no effect should follow, which is absurd.
4854_24732_000010_000000	Moreover, I will show below, without the aid of this proposition, that neither intellect nor will appertain to God's nature.	Moreover, I will show below, without the aid of this proposition, that neither intellect nor will appertain to God's nature.
4854_24732_000010_000001	I know that there are many who think that they can show, that supreme intellect and free will do appertain to God's nature; for they say they know of nothing more perfect, which they can attribute to God, than that which is the highest perfection in ourselves.	I know that there are many who think that they can show, that supreme intellect and free will do appertain to God's nature; for they say they know of nothing more perfect, which they can attribute to God, than that which is the highest perfection in ourselves.
4854_24732_000010_000002	Further, although they conceive God as actually supremely intelligent, they yet do not believe that he can bring into existence everything which he actually understands, for they think that they would thus destroy God's power.	Further, although they conceive God as actually supremely intelligent, they yet do not believe that he can bring into existence everything which he actually understands, for they think that they would thus destroy God's power.
4854_24732_000010_000006	This manner of treating the question attributes to God an omnipotence, in my opinion, far more perfect.	This manner of treating the question attributes to God an omnipotence, in my opinion, far more perfect.
4854_24732_000010_000007	For, otherwise, we are compelled to confess that God understands an infinite number of creatable things, which he will never be able to create, for, if he created all that he understands, he would, according to this showing, exhaust his omnipotence, and render himself imperfect.	For, otherwise, we are compelled to confess that God understands an infinite number of creatable things, which he will never be able to create, for, if he created all that he understands, he would, according to this showing, exhaust his omnipotence, and render himself imperfect.
4854_24732_000010_000008	Wherefore, in order to establish that God is perfect, we should be reduced to establishing at the same time, that he cannot bring to pass everything over which his power extends; this seems to be a hypothesis most absurd, and most repugnant to God's omnipotence.	Wherefore, in order to establish that God is perfect, we should be reduced to establishing at the same time, that he cannot bring to pass everything over which his power extends; this seems to be a hypothesis most absurd, and most repugnant to God's omnipotence.
4854_24732_000011_000000	Further (to say a word here concerning the intellect and the will which we attribute to God), if intellect and will appertain to the eternal essence of God, we must take these words in some significance quite different from those they usually bear.	Further (to say a word here concerning the intellect and the will which we attribute to God), if intellect and will appertain to the eternal essence of God, we must take these words in some significance quite different from those they usually bear.
4854_24732_000011_000001	For intellect and will, which should constitute the essence of God, would perforce be as far apart as the poles from the human intellect and will, in fact, would have nothing in common with them but the name; there would be about as much correspondence between the two as there is between the Dog, the heavenly constellation, and a dog, an animal that barks.	For intellect and will, which should constitute the essence of God, would perforce be as far apart as the poles from the human intellect and will, in fact, would have nothing in common with them but the name; there would be about as much correspondence between the two as there is between the Dog, the heavenly constellation, and a dog, an animal that barks.
4854_24732_000011_000002	This I will prove as follows.	This I will prove as follows.
4854_24732_000011_000006	This seems to have been recognized by those who have asserted, that God's intellect, God's will, and God's power, are one and the same.	This seems to have been recognized by those who have asserted, that God's intellect, God's will, and God's power, are one and the same.
4854_24732_000011_000007	As, therefore, God's intellect is the sole cause of things, namely, both of their essence and existence, it must necessarily differ from them in respect to its essence, and in respect to its existence.	As, therefore, God's intellect is the sole cause of things, namely, both of their essence and existence, it must necessarily differ from them in respect to its essence, and in respect to its existence.
4854_24732_000011_000008	For a cause differs from a thing it causes, precisely in the quality which the latter gains from the former.	For a cause differs from a thing it causes, precisely in the quality which the latter gains from the former.
4854_24732_000012_000001	Wherefore, a thing which is the cause both of the essence and of the existence of a given effect, must differ from such effect both in respect to its essence, and also in respect to its existence.	Wherefore, a thing which is the cause both of the essence and of the existence of a given effect, must differ from such effect both in respect to its essence, and also in respect to its existence.
4854_24732_000014_000002	This is our second point.	This is our second point.
4854_24732_000014_000003	God, therefore, is the indwelling and not the transient cause of all things.	God, therefore, is the indwelling and not the transient cause of all things.
4854_24732_000015_000001	God, and all the attributes of God, are eternal.	God, and all the attributes of God, are eternal.

4854_24732_000018_000001	The existence of God and his essence are one and the same.	The existence of God and his essence are one and the same.
4854_24732_000019_000001	Therefore the same attributes of God which explain his eternal essence, explain at the same time his eternal existence--in other words, that which constitutes God's essence constitutes at the same time his existence.	Therefore the same attributes of God which explain his eternal essence, explain at the same time his eternal existence-in other words, that which constitutes God's essence constitutes at the same time his existence.

For if they could be changed in respect to existence, they must also be able to be changed in respect to essence-that is, obviously, be changed from true to false, which is absurd.
