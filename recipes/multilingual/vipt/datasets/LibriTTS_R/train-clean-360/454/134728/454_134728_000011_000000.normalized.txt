To those who've fail'd, in aspiration vast, To unnam'd soldiers fallen in front on the lead, To calm, devoted engineers-to over ardent travelers-to pilots on their ships, To many a lofty song and picture without recognition-I'd rear laurel cover'd monument, High, high above the rest-To all cut off before their time, Possess'd by some strange spirit of fire, Quench'd by an early death.
