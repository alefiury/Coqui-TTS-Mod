And as each body spent out of its ebbing store Of strength and hope, I felt the forward thrust, At first so sure, Fail in its rhythm, Falter slow, And slower- Hang an endless moment- Till in a rush came fear- Fear of the sea, that it might win again, Gathering one crew more, Making them pay in vain.
