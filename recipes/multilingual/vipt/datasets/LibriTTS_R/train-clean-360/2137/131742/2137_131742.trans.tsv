His lamp was pronounced a fake, a myth, possibly a momentary success magnified to the dignity of a permanent device by an overenthusiastic inventor.

2137_131742_000004_000000	He was convinced from the first that the true solution of the problem lay in a lamp which should have as its illuminating body a strip of material which would offer such a resistance to the flow of electric current that it could be raised to a high temperature--incandescence--and be of such small cross-section that it would radiate but little heat.

2137_131742_000005_000000	It is interesting to note that these conceptions were in Edison's mind at an early period of his investigations, when the best expert opinion was that the subdivision of the electric current was an ignis fatuus. Hence we quote the following notes he made, November 15, 1878, in one of the laboratory note-books:	It is interesting to note that these conceptions were in Edison's mind at an early period of his investigations, when the best expert opinion was that the subdivision of the electric current was an ignis fatuus. Hence we quote the following notes he made, november fifteenth eighteen seventy eight, in one of the laboratory note books:
2137_131742_000006_000000	"A given straight wire having 1 ohm resistance and certain length is brought to a given degree of temperature by given battery.	"A given straight wire having one ohm resistance and certain length is brought to a given degree of temperature by given battery.
2137_131742_000006_000001	If the same wire be coiled in such a manner that but one-quarter of its surface radiates, its temperature will be increased four times with the same battery, or, one-quarter of this battery will bring it to the temperature of straight wire.	If the same wire be coiled in such a manner that but one quarter of its surface radiates, its temperature will be increased four times with the same battery, or, one quarter of this battery will bring it to the temperature of straight wire.

2137_131742_000008_000001	If one square inch of platina be heated to 100 degrees it will fall to, say, zero in one second, whereas, if it was at 200 degrees it would require two seconds.	If one square inch of platina be heated to one hundred degrees it will fall to, say, zero in one second, whereas, if it was at two hundred degrees it would require two seconds.
2137_131742_000009_000000	"Hence, in the case of incandescent conductors, if the radiating surface be twelve inches and the temperature on each inch be 100, or 1200 for all, if it is so coiled or arranged that there is but one-quarter, or three inches, of radiating surface, then the temperature on each inch will be 400.	"Hence, in the case of incandescent conductors, if the radiating surface be twelve inches and the temperature on each inch be one hundred, or twelve hundred for all, if it is so coiled or arranged that there is but one quarter, or three inches, of radiating surface, then the temperature on each inch will be four hundred.
2137_131742_000009_000003	To carry out this law to the best advantage in regard to platina, etc., then with a given length of wire to quadruple the heat we must lessen the radiating surface to one-quarter, and to do this in a spiral, three-quarters must be within the spiral and one-quarter outside for radiating; hence, a square wire or other means, such as a spiral within a spiral, must be used.
