There were three long tables, fairly groaning with things upon them: buffalo, antelope, boiled ham, several kinds of vegetables, pies, cakes, quantities of pickles, dried "apple duff," and coffee, and in the center of each table, high up, was a huge cake thickly covered with icing. These were the cakes that mrs Phillips, mrs Barker, and I had sent over that morning.
