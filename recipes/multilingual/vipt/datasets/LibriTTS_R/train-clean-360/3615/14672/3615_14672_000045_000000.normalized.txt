Peel and boil three sweet potatoes in salted water until tender; then mash well with three beaten yolks of eggs, one cup of milk, three tablespoonfuls of butter, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, a pinch of nutmeg and lemon juice. Beat the whites with a pinch of salt to a stiff froth; add to the potatoes and put in a well buttered baking dish and bake.
