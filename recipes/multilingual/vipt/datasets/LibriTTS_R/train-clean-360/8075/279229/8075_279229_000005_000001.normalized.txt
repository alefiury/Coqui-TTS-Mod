Since that time I have practically lived among newts, jotting down observations, making lantern slides, watching them in their work and in their play (and you may rest assured that the little rogues have their play-as who does not?) until, from much lying in a research posture on my stomach, over the inclosure in which they were confined, I found myself developing what I feared might be rudimentary creepers.
