3977_185457_000007_000001	That it did not serve as food for the mature bees, was evident from the fact that large supplies are often found in hives whose inmates have starved to death.

3977_185457_000007_000003	After Huber had demonstrated that wax is secreted from an entirely different substance, he was soon led to conjecture that the bee-bread must be used for the nourishment of the embryo bees.

3977_185457_000009_000000	In the backward spring of 1852, I had an excellent opportunity of testing the value of this substance.	In the backward spring of eighteen fifty two, I had an excellent opportunity of testing the value of this substance.

3977_185457_000009_000003	I opened it on the 5th of February, and although the weather, until within a week of that time, had been unusually cold, I found many of the cells filled with brood.

3977_185457_000011_000001	My experiments do not corroborate this theory, but tend to confirm the views of Huber, and to show the absolute necessity of pollen to the development of brood.

3977_185457_000011_000002	The same able contributor to Apiarian science, thinks that pollen is used by the bees when they are engaged in comb-building; and that unless they are well supplied with it, they cannot rapidly secrete wax, without very severely taxing their strength.

3977_185457_000011_000003	But as all the elements of wax are found in honey, and none of them in pollen, this opinion does not seem to me, to be entitled to much weight.	But as all the elements of wax are found in honey, and none of them in pollen, this opinion does not seem to me, to be entitled to much weight.
3977_185457_000011_000004	That bees cannot live upon pollen without any honey, is proved by the fact, that large stores of it are often found, in hives whose occupants have died of starvation; that they can live without it, is equally well known; but that the full grown bees make some use of it in connection with honey, for their own nourishment, I believe to be highly probable.

3977_185457_000014_000001	The body of the bee appears, to the naked eye, to be covered with fine hairs; to these, when the bee alights on a flower, the farina adheres.

3977_185457_000016_000000	It has been observed that a bee, in gathering pollen, always confines herself to the same kind of flower on which she begins, even when that is not so abundant as some others.

3977_185457_000016_000001	Thus if you examine a ball of this substance taken from her thigh, it is found to be of one uniform color throughout: the load of one will be yellow, another red, and a third brown; the color varying according to that of the plant from which it was obtained.

3977_185457_000016_000003	It is certain that if they flew from one species to another, there would be a much greater mixture of different varieties than there now is, for they carry on their bodies the pollen or fertilizing principle, and thus aid most powerfully in the impregnation of plants.

3977_185457_000019_000001	At first the importance of its products, when honey was the only natural sweet, served most powerfully to attract his attention to its curious habits; and now since the cultivation of the sugar cane has diminished the relative value of its luscious sweets, the superior knowledge which has been obtained of its instincts, is awakening an increasing enthusiasm in its cultivation.
