Horsey was the name of the gentleman from whom it was said that he obtained the favor; so when the time was up for the payment to be made, the dr was not prepared. Horsey, therefore, claimed the collateral (the wife) and thus she had to meet the issue, or make a timely escape to Canada with her husband.
