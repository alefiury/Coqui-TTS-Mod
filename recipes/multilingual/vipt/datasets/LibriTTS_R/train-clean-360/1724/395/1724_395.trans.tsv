1724_395_000009_000001	Moderation in the affections and passions, self-control, and calm deliberation are not only good in many respects, but even seem to constitute part of the intrinsic worth of the person; but they are far from deserving to be called good without qualification, although they have been so unconditionally praised by the ancients.	Moderation in the affections and passions, self control, and calm deliberation are not only good in many respects, but even seem to constitute part of the intrinsic worth of the person; but they are far from deserving to be called good without qualification, although they have been so unconditionally praised by the ancients.
1724_395_000009_000002	For without the principles of a good will, they may become extremely bad, and the coolness of a villain not only makes him far more dangerous, but also directly makes him more abominable in our eyes than he would have been without it.	For without the principles of a good will, they may become extremely bad, and the coolness of a villain not only makes him far more dangerous, but also directly makes him more abominable in our eyes than he would have been without it.
1724_395_000010_000000	A good will is good not because of what it performs or effects, not by its aptness for the attainment of some proposed end, but simply by virtue of the volition; that is, it is good in itself, and considered by itself is to be esteemed much higher than all that can be brought about by it in favour of any inclination, nay even of the sum total of all inclinations.	A good will is good not because of what it performs or effects, not by its aptness for the attainment of some proposed end, but simply by virtue of the volition; that is, it is good in itself, and considered by itself is to be esteemed much higher than all that can be brought about by it in favour of any inclination, nay even of the sum total of all inclinations.

1724_395_000012_000000	In the physical constitution of an organized being, that is, a being adapted suitably to the purposes of life, we assume it as a fundamental principle that no organ for any purpose will be found but what is also the fittest and best adapted for that purpose.

1724_395_000012_000004	In a word, nature would have taken care that reason should not break forth into practical exercise, nor have the presumption, with its weak insight, to think out for itself the plan of happiness, and of the means of attaining it.	In a word, nature would have taken care that reason should not break forth into practical exercise, nor have the presumption, with its weak insight, to think out for itself the plan of happiness, and of the means of attaining it.
1724_395_000012_000005	Nature would not only have taken on herself the choice of the ends, but also of the means, and with wise foresight would have entrusted both to instinct.	Nature would not only have taken on herself the choice of the ends, but also of the means, and with wise foresight would have entrusted both to instinct.
1724_395_000014_000001	This will then, though not indeed the sole and complete good, must be the supreme good and the condition of every other, even of the desire of happiness.	This will then, though not indeed the sole and complete good, must be the supreme good and the condition of every other, even of the desire of happiness.
1724_395_000014_000003	Nay, it may even reduce it to nothing, without nature thereby failing of her purpose.	Nay, it may even reduce it to nothing, without nature thereby failing of her purpose.
1724_395_000014_000004	For reason recognizes the establishment of a good will as its highest practical destination, and in attaining this purpose is capable only of a satisfaction of its own proper kind, namely that from the attainment of an end, which end again is determined by reason only, notwithstanding that this may involve many a disappointment to the ends of inclination.	For reason recognizes the establishment of a good will as its highest practical destination, and in attaining this purpose is capable only of a satisfaction of its own proper kind, namely that from the attainment of an end, which end again is determined by reason only, notwithstanding that this may involve many a disappointment to the ends of inclination.
1724_395_000015_000000	We have then to develop the notion of a will which deserves to be highly esteemed for itself and is good without a view to anything further, a notion which exists already in the sound natural understanding, requiring rather to be cleared up than to be taught, and which in estimating the value of our actions always takes the first place and constitutes the condition of all the rest.	We have then to develop the notion of a will which deserves to be highly esteemed for itself and is good without a view to anything further, a notion which exists already in the sound natural understanding, requiring rather to be cleared up than to be taught, and which in estimating the value of our actions always takes the first place and constitutes the condition of all the rest.
1724_395_000015_000001	In order to do this, we will take the notion of duty, which includes that of a good will, although implying certain subjective restrictions and hindrances.

1724_395_000015_000002	These, however, far from concealing it, or rendering it unrecognizable, rather bring it out by contrast and make it shine forth so much the brighter.	These, however, far from concealing it, or rendering it unrecognizable, rather bring it out by contrast and make it shine forth so much the brighter.
1724_395_000016_000000	I omit here all actions which are already recognized as inconsistent with duty, although they may be useful for this or that purpose, for with these the question whether they are done from duty cannot arise at all, since they even conflict with it.	I omit here all actions which are already recognized as inconsistent with duty, although they may be useful for this or that purpose, for with these the question whether they are done from duty cannot arise at all, since they even conflict with it.
1724_395_000016_000001	I also set aside those actions which really conform to duty, but to which men have no direct inclination, performing them because they are impelled thereto by some other inclination.	I also set aside those actions which really conform to duty, but to which men have no direct inclination, performing them because they are impelled thereto by some other inclination.
1724_395_000016_000002	For in this case we can readily distinguish whether the action which agrees with duty is done from duty, or from a selfish view.	For in this case we can readily distinguish whether the action which agrees with duty is done from duty, or from a selfish view.
1724_395_000016_000006	Accordingly the action was done neither from duty nor from direct inclination, but merely with a selfish view.	Accordingly the action was done neither from duty nor from direct inclination, but merely with a selfish view.
1724_395_000018_000002	For the maxim lacks the moral import, namely, that such actions be done from duty, not from inclination.	For the maxim lacks the moral import, namely, that such actions be done from duty, not from inclination.
1724_395_000019_000001	But here again, without looking to duty, all men have already the strongest and most intimate inclination to happiness, because it is just in this idea that all inclinations are combined in one total.	But here again, without looking to duty, all men have already the strongest and most intimate inclination to happiness, because it is just in this idea that all inclinations are combined in one total.
1724_395_000019_000004	But even in this case, if the general desire for happiness did not influence his will, and supposing that in his particular case health was not a necessary element in this calculation, there yet remains in this, as in all other cases, this law, namely, that he should promote his happiness not from inclination but from duty, and by this would his conduct first acquire true moral worth.	But even in this case, if the general desire for happiness did not influence his will, and supposing that in his particular case health was not a necessary element in this calculation, there yet remains in this, as in all other cases, this law, namely, that he should promote his happiness not from inclination but from duty, and by this would his conduct first acquire true moral worth.
1724_395_000020_000000	It is in this manner, undoubtedly, that we are to understand those passages of Scripture also in which we are commanded to love our neighbour, even our enemy.	It is in this manner, undoubtedly, that we are to understand those passages of Scripture also in which we are commanded to love our neighbour, even our enemy.
1724_395_000020_000001	For love, as an affection, cannot be commanded, but beneficence for duty's sake may; even though we are not impelled to it by any inclination- nay, are even repelled by a natural and unconquerable aversion.	For love, as an affection, cannot be commanded, but beneficence for duty's sake may; even though we are not impelled to it by any inclination nay, are even repelled by a natural and unconquerable aversion.
1724_395_000020_000002	This is practical love and not pathological- a love which is seated in the will, and not in the propensions of sense- in principles of action and not of tender sympathy; and it is this love alone which can be commanded.	This is practical love and not pathological a love which is seated in the will, and not in the propensions of sense in principles of action and not of tender sympathy; and it is this love alone which can be commanded.
1724_395_000021_000000	The second proposition is: That an action done from duty derives its moral worth, not from the purpose which is to be attained by it, but from the maxim by which it is determined, and therefore does not depend on the realization of the object of the action, but merely on the principle of volition by which the action has taken place, without regard to any object of desire.	The second proposition is: That an action done from duty derives its moral worth, not from the purpose which is to be attained by it, but from the maxim by which it is determined, and therefore does not depend on the realization of the object of the action, but merely on the principle of volition by which the action has taken place, without regard to any object of desire.
1724_395_000021_000001	It is clear from what precedes that the purposes which we may have in view in our actions, or their effects regarded as ends and springs of the will, cannot give to actions any unconditional or moral worth.	It is clear from what precedes that the purposes which we may have in view in our actions, or their effects regarded as ends and springs of the will, cannot give to actions any unconditional or moral worth.
1724_395_000021_000002	In what, then, can their worth lie, if it is not to consist in the will and in reference to its expected effect?	In what, then, can their worth lie, if it is not to consist in the will and in reference to its expected effect?
1724_395_000022_000000	The third proposition, which is a consequence of the two preceding, I would express thus Duty is the necessity of acting from respect for the law.	The third proposition, which is a consequence of the two preceding, I would express thus Duty is the necessity of acting from respect for the law.
1724_395_000022_000002	It is only what is connected with my will as a principle, by no means as an effect- what does not subserve my inclination, but overpowers it, or at least in case of choice excludes it from its calculation- in other words, simply the law of itself, which can be an object of respect, and hence a command.	It is only what is connected with my will as a principle, by no means as an effect what does not subserve my inclination, but overpowers it, or at least in case of choice excludes it from its calculation in other words, simply the law of itself, which can be an object of respect, and hence a command.
1724_395_000024_000002	The pre-eminent good which we call moral can therefore consist in nothing else than the conception of law in itself, which certainly is only possible in a rational being, in so far as this conception, and not the expected effect, determines the will.	The pre-eminent good which we call moral can therefore consist in nothing else than the conception of law in itself, which certainly is only possible in a rational being, in so far as this conception, and not the expected effect, determines the will.
1724_395_000024_000003	This is a good which is already present in the person who acts accordingly, and we have not to wait for it to appear first in the result.	This is a good which is already present in the person who acts accordingly, and we have not to wait for it to appear first in the result.
1724_395_000025_000003	Accordingly it is something which is considered neither as an object of inclination nor of fear, although it has something analogous to both.	Accordingly it is something which is considered neither as an object of inclination nor of fear, although it has something analogous to both.
1724_395_000025_000004	The object of respect is the law only, and that the law which we impose on ourselves and yet recognise as necessary in itself.	The object of respect is the law only, and that the law which we impose on ourselves and yet recognise as necessary in itself.
1724_395_000025_000005	As a law, we are subjected too it without consulting self-love; as imposed by us on ourselves, it is a result of our will.	As a law, we are subjected too it without consulting self love; as imposed by us on ourselves, it is a result of our will.
1724_395_000025_000006	In the former aspect it has an analogy to fear, in the latter to inclination.	In the former aspect it has an analogy to fear, in the latter to inclination.
1724_395_000025_000007	Respect for a person is properly only respect for the law (of honesty, etc.) of which he gives us an example.	Respect for a person is properly only respect for the law (of honesty, etc) of which he gives us an example.
1724_395_000026_000001	As I have deprived the will of every impulse which could arise to it from obedience to any law, there remains nothing but the universal conformity of its actions to law in general, which alone is to serve the will as a principle, i.e., I am never to act otherwise than so that I could also will that my maxim should become a universal law.	As I have deprived the will of every impulse which could arise to it from obedience to any law, there remains nothing but the universal conformity of its actions to law in general, which alone is to serve the will as a principle, i e, I am never to act otherwise than so that I could also will that my maxim should become a universal law.
1724_395_000026_000002	Here, now, it is the simple conformity to law in general, without assuming any particular law applicable to certain actions, that serves the will as its principle and must so serve it, if duty is not to be a vain delusion and a chimerical notion.	Here, now, it is the simple conformity to law in general, without assuming any particular law applicable to certain actions, that serves the will as its principle and must so serve it, if duty is not to be a vain delusion and a chimerical notion.
1724_395_000026_000003	The common reason of men in its practical judgements perfectly coincides with this and always has in view the principle here suggested.	The common reason of men in its practical judgements perfectly coincides with this and always has in view the principle here suggested.
1724_395_000026_000008	But it is soon clear to me that such a maxim will still only be based on the fear of consequences.	But it is soon clear to me that such a maxim will still only be based on the fear of consequences.
1724_395_000026_000009	Now it is a wholly different thing to be truthful from duty and to be so from apprehension of injurious consequences.	Now it is a wholly different thing to be truthful from duty and to be so from apprehension of injurious consequences.
1724_395_000026_000010	In the first case, the very notion of the action already implies a law for me; in the second case, I must first look about elsewhere to see what results may be combined with it which would affect myself.	In the first case, the very notion of the action already implies a law for me; in the second case, I must first look about elsewhere to see what results may be combined with it which would affect myself.
1724_395_000026_000011	For to deviate from the principle of duty is beyond all doubt wicked; but to be unfaithful to my maxim of prudence may often be very advantageous to me, although to abide by it is certainly safer.	For to deviate from the principle of duty is beyond all doubt wicked; but to be unfaithful to my maxim of prudence may often be very advantageous to me, although to abide by it is certainly safer.
1724_395_000026_000014	For with such a law there would be no promises at all, since it would be in vain to allege my intention in regard to my future actions to those who would not believe this allegation, or if they over hastily did so would pay me back in my own coin.	For with such a law there would be no promises at all, since it would be in vain to allege my intention in regard to my future actions to those who would not believe this allegation, or if they over hastily did so would pay me back in my own coin.
1724_395_000026_000015	Hence my maxim, as soon as it should be made a universal law, would necessarily destroy itself.	Hence my maxim, as soon as it should be made a universal law, would necessarily destroy itself.
1724_395_000028_000000	Thus, then, without quitting the moral knowledge of common human reason, we have arrived at its principle.	Thus, then, without quitting the moral knowledge of common human reason, we have arrived at its principle.
1724_395_000028_000005	In the latter, if common reason ventures to depart from the laws of experience and from the perceptions of the senses, it falls into mere inconceivabilities and self-contradictions, at least into a chaos of uncertainty, obscurity, and instability.	In the latter, if common reason ventures to depart from the laws of experience and from the perceptions of the senses, it falls into mere inconceivabilities and self contradictions, at least into a chaos of uncertainty, obscurity, and instability.
1724_395_000028_000006	But in the practical sphere it is just when the common understanding excludes all sensible springs from practical laws that its power of judgement begins to show itself to advantage.	But in the practical sphere it is just when the common understanding excludes all sensible springs from practical laws that its power of judgement begins to show itself to advantage.
1724_395_000028_000008	Nay, it is almost more sure of doing so, because the philosopher cannot have any other principle, while he may easily perplex his judgement by a multitude of considerations foreign to the matter, and so turn aside from the right way.

1724_395_000029_000000	Innocence is indeed a glorious thing; only, on the other hand, it is very sad that it cannot well maintain itself and is easily seduced.	Innocence is indeed a glorious thing; only, on the other hand, it is very sad that it cannot well maintain itself and is easily seduced.
1724_395_000029_000002	Against all the commands of duty which reason represents to man as so deserving of respect, he feels in himself a powerful counterpoise in his wants and inclinations, the entire satisfaction of which he sums up under the name of happiness.	Against all the commands of duty which reason represents to man as so deserving of respect, he feels in himself a powerful counterpoise in his wants and inclinations, the entire satisfaction of which he sums up under the name of happiness.
1724_395_000029_000003	Now reason issues its commands unyieldingly, without promising anything to the inclinations, and, as it were, with disregard and contempt for these claims, which are so impetuous, and at the same time so plausible, and which will not allow themselves to be suppressed by any command.	Now reason issues its commands unyieldingly, without promising anything to the inclinations, and, as it were, with disregard and contempt for these claims, which are so impetuous, and at the same time so plausible, and which will not allow themselves to be suppressed by any command.
1724_395_000029_000004	Hence there arises a natural dialectic, i.e., a disposition, to argue against these strict laws of duty and to question their validity, or at least their purity and strictness; and, if possible, to make them more accordant with our wishes and inclinations, that is to say, to corrupt them at their very source, and entirely to destroy their worth- a thing which even common practical reason cannot ultimately call good.
