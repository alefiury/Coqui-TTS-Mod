The more reflective and self conscious a man is the more completely will his experience be subsumed and absorbed in his perennial "I." If philosophy has come to reinforce this reflective egotism, he may even regard all nature as nothing but his half voluntary dream and encourage himself thereby to give even to the physical world a dramatic and sentimental colour.
