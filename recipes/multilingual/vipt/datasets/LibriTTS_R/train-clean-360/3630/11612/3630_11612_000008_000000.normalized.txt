This phenomenon of sound transmission may perhaps be made more clear by the old illustration of a series of eight billiard balls in a row on a table: if the first ball is tapped lightly, striking gently against ball number two, the latter (as well as numbers three, four, five, six, and seven) will not apparently move at all, but ball number eight at the other end will roll away.
