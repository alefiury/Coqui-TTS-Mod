Melt a tea cup of butter-mix it with two thirds of a pint of milk, (if you have not any milk, water may be substituted, but the biscuit will not be as nice.) Put in a tea spoonful of salt, half a tea cup of yeast, (milk yeast is the best, see directions for making it)--stir in flour till it is stiff enough to mould up.
