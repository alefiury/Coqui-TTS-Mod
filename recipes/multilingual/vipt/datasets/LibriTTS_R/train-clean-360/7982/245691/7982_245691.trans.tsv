7982_245691_000036_000001	Firstly, in its most strict sense, when from a thing is taken something which belongs to it by virtue either of its nature, or of its proper inclination: as when water loses coolness by heating, and as when a man becomes ill or sad.	Firstly, in its most strict sense, when from a thing is taken something which belongs to it by virtue either of its nature, or of its proper inclination: as when water loses coolness by heating, and as when a man becomes ill or sad.

7982_245691_000036_000004	Thirdly, in a wide sense a thing is said to be passive, from the very fact that what is in potentiality to something receives that to which it was in potentiality, without being deprived of anything.	Thirdly, in a wide sense a thing is said to be passive, from the very fact that what is in potentiality to something receives that to which it was in potentiality, without being deprived of anything.
7982_245691_000036_000005	And accordingly, whatever passes from potentiality to act, may be said to be passive, even when it is perfected.	And accordingly, whatever passes from potentiality to act, may be said to be passive, even when it is perfected.
7982_245691_000036_000006	And thus with us to understand is to be passive.	And thus with us to understand is to be passive.
7982_245691_000036_000007	This is clear from the following reason.	This is clear from the following reason.
7982_245691_000036_000009	We may therefore see whether the intellect be in act or potentiality by observing first of all the nature of the relation of the intellect to universal being.	We may therefore see whether the intellect be in act or potentiality by observing first of all the nature of the relation of the intellect to universal being.
7982_245691_000036_000010	For we find an intellect whose relation to universal being is that of the act of all being: and such is the Divine intellect, which is the Essence of God, in which originally and virtually, all being pre-exists as in its first cause.	For we find an intellect whose relation to universal being is that of the act of all being: and such is the Divine intellect, which is the Essence of God, in which originally and virtually, all being pre exists as in its first cause.
7982_245691_000036_000011	And therefore the Divine intellect is not in potentiality, but is pure act.	And therefore the Divine intellect is not in potentiality, but is pure act.
7982_245691_000036_000012	But no created intellect can be an act in relation to the whole universal being; otherwise it would needs be an infinite being.	But no created intellect can be an act in relation to the whole universal being; otherwise it would needs be an infinite being.
7982_245691_000036_000013	Wherefore every created intellect is not the act of all things intelligible, by reason of its very existence; but is compared to these intelligible things as a potentiality to act.	Wherefore every created intellect is not the act of all things intelligible, by reason of its very existence; but is compared to these intelligible things as a potentiality to act.
7982_245691_000037_000000	Now, potentiality has a double relation to act.	Now, potentiality has a double relation to act.
7982_245691_000037_000003	And there is another potentiality which is not always in act, but proceeds from potentiality to act; as we observe in things that are corrupted and generated.	And there is another potentiality which is not always in act, but proceeds from potentiality to act; as we observe in things that are corrupted and generated.
7982_245691_000037_000004	Wherefore the angelic intellect is always in act as regards those things which it can understand, by reason of its proximity to the first intellect, which is pure act, as we have said above.	Wherefore the angelic intellect is always in act as regards those things which it can understand, by reason of its proximity to the first intellect, which is pure act, as we have said above.
7982_245691_000037_000006	This is made clear from the fact, that at first we are only in potentiality to understand, and afterwards we are made to understand actually.	This is made clear from the fact, that at first we are only in potentiality to understand, and afterwards we are made to understand actually.
7982_245691_000037_000008	And consequently the intellect is a passive power.	And consequently the intellect is a passive power.
7982_245691_000038_000001	But in the third sense passion is in anything which is reduced from potentiality to act.	But in the third sense passion is in anything which is reduced from potentiality to act.
7982_245691_000039_000004	Hence it is incorruptible.	Hence it is incorruptible.
7982_245691_000040_000001	Now the intellect is a passive power in regard to the whole universal being: while the vegetative power is active in regard to some particular thing, namely, the body as united to the soul.	Now the intellect is a passive power in regard to the whole universal being: while the vegetative power is active in regard to some particular thing, namely, the body as united to the soul.
7982_245691_000042_000000	Whether There Is an Active Intellect?	Whether There Is an Active Intellect?
7982_245691_000043_000000	Objection 1: It would seem that there is no active intellect.	Objection one: It would seem that there is no active intellect.
7982_245691_000043_000001	For as the senses are to things sensible, so is our intellect to things intelligible.	For as the senses are to things sensible, so is our intellect to things intelligible.
7982_245691_000043_000002	But because sense is in potentiality to things sensible, the sense is not said to be active, but only passive.	But because sense is in potentiality to things sensible, the sense is not said to be active, but only passive.
7982_245691_000043_000003	Therefore, since our intellect is in potentiality to things intelligible, it seems that we cannot say that the intellect is active, but only that it is passive.	Therefore, since our intellect is in potentiality to things intelligible, it seems that we cannot say that the intellect is active, but only that it is passive.
7982_245691_000044_000001	But in the operation of the intellect there is no appointed medium that has to be brought into act.	But in the operation of the intellect there is no appointed medium that has to be brought into act.
7982_245691_000044_000002	Therefore there is no necessity for an active intellect.	Therefore there is no necessity for an active intellect.
7982_245691_000045_000001	But the passive intellect is an immaterial power.	But the passive intellect is an immaterial power.
7982_245691_000045_000003	Now a form is intelligible in act from the very fact that it is immaterial. Therefore there is no need for an active intellect to make the species actually intelligible.	Now a form is intelligible in act from the very fact that it is immaterial. Therefore there is no need for an active intellect to make the species actually intelligible.
7982_245691_000047_000001	For Plato supposed that the forms of natural things subsisted apart from matter, and consequently that they are intelligible: since a thing is actually intelligible from the very fact that it is immaterial.	For Plato supposed that the forms of natural things subsisted apart from matter, and consequently that they are intelligible: since a thing is actually intelligible from the very fact that it is immaterial.
7982_245691_000047_000003	But since Aristotle did not allow that forms of natural things exist apart from matter, and as forms existing in matter are not actually intelligible; it follows that the natures or forms of the sensible things which we understand are not actually intelligible.	But since Aristotle did not allow that forms of natural things exist apart from matter, and as forms existing in matter are not actually intelligible; it follows that the natures or forms of the sensible things which we understand are not actually intelligible.
7982_245691_000047_000004	Now nothing is reduced from potentiality to act except by something in act; as the senses as made actual by what is actually sensible.	Now nothing is reduced from potentiality to act except by something in act; as the senses as made actual by what is actually sensible.
7982_245691_000047_000005	We must therefore assign on the part of the intellect some power to make things actually intelligible, by abstraction of the species from material conditions.	We must therefore assign on the part of the intellect some power to make things actually intelligible, by abstraction of the species from material conditions.
7982_245691_000048_000001	Wherefore it is clear that in the nutritive part all the powers are active, whereas in the sensitive part all are passive: but in the intellectual part, there is something active and something passive.	Wherefore it is clear that in the nutritive part all the powers are active, whereas in the sensitive part all are passive: but in the intellectual part, there is something active and something passive.
7982_245691_000049_000001	For some say that light is required for sight, in order to make colors actually visible.	For some say that light is required for sight, in order to make colors actually visible.
7982_245691_000049_000002	And according to this the active intellect is required for understanding, in like manner and for the same reason as light is required for seeing.	And according to this the active intellect is required for understanding, in like manner and for the same reason as light is required for seeing.
7982_245691_000050_000001	But if the agent does not pre-exist, the disposition of the recipient has nothing to do with the matter.	But if the agent does not pre exist, the disposition of the recipient has nothing to do with the matter.
7982_245691_000050_000002	Now the intelligible in act is not something existing in nature; if we consider the nature of things sensible, which do not subsist apart from matter.	Now the intelligible in act is not something existing in nature; if we consider the nature of things sensible, which do not subsist apart from matter.

7982_245691_000055_000001	If, therefore, the passive intellect, which is a passive power, is something belonging to the soul; and also the active intellect, which is an active power: it follows that a man would always be able to understand when he wished, which is clearly false.	If, therefore, the passive intellect, which is a passive power, is something belonging to the soul; and also the active intellect, which is an active power: it follows that a man would always be able to understand when he wished, which is clearly false.
7982_245691_000055_000002	Therefore the active intellect is not something in our soul.	Therefore the active intellect is not something in our soul.
7982_245691_000056_000001	If, therefore, the passive intellect, which is in potentiality to all things intelligible, is something in the soul, it seems impossible for the active intellect to be also something in our soul.	If, therefore, the passive intellect, which is in potentiality to all things intelligible, is something in the soul, it seems impossible for the active intellect to be also something in our soul.
7982_245691_000057_000001	For it is neither a passion nor a habit; since habits and passions are not in the nature of agents in regard to the passivity of the soul; but rather passion is the very action of the passive power; while habit is something which results from acts.	For it is neither a passion nor a habit; since habits and passions are not in the nature of agents in regard to the passivity of the soul; but rather passion is the very action of the passive power; while habit is something which results from acts.
7982_245691_000057_000002	But every power flows from the essence of the soul.	But every power flows from the essence of the soul.
7982_245691_000057_000003	It would therefore follow that the active intellect flows from the essence of the soul.

7982_245691_000059_000001	In order to make this evident, we must observe that above the intellectual soul of man we must needs suppose a superior intellect, from which the soul acquires the power of understanding.	In order to make this evident, we must observe that above the intellectual soul of man we must needs suppose a superior intellect, from which the soul acquires the power of understanding.
7982_245691_000059_000002	For what is such by participation, and what is mobile, and what is imperfect always requires the pre-existence of something essentially such, immovable and perfect.	For what is such by participation, and what is mobile, and what is imperfect always requires the pre existence of something essentially such, immovable and perfect.
7982_245691_000059_000003	Now the human soul is called intellectual by reason of a participation in intellectual power; a sign of which is that it is not wholly intellectual but only in part.	Now the human soul is called intellectual by reason of a participation in intellectual power; a sign of which is that it is not wholly intellectual but only in part.
7982_245691_000059_000005	Again it has an imperfect understanding; both because it does not understand everything, and because, in those things which it does understand, it passes from potentiality to act.	Again it has an imperfect understanding; both because it does not understand everything, and because, in those things which it does understand, it passes from potentiality to act.

Wherefore some held that this intellect, substantially separate, is the active intellect, which by lighting up the phantasms as it were, makes them to be actually intelligible.
7982_245691_000060_000001	But, even supposing the existence of such a separate active intellect, it would still be necessary to assign to the human soul some power participating in that superior intellect, by which power the human soul makes things actually intelligible.	But, even supposing the existence of such a separate active intellect, it would still be necessary to assign to the human soul some power participating in that superior intellect, by which power the human soul makes things actually intelligible.
7982_245691_000060_000002	Just as in other perfect natural things, besides the universal active causes, each one is endowed with its proper powers derived from those universal causes: for the sun alone does not generate man; but in man is the power of begetting man: and in like manner with other perfect animals.
