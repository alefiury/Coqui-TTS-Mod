Monday's child is fair of face, Tuesday's child is full of grace; Wednesday's child is merry and glad, Thursday's child is sorry and sad; Friday's child is loving and giving; Saturday's child must work for its living; While the child that is born on the Sabbath day Is blithe and bonny and good and gay.
