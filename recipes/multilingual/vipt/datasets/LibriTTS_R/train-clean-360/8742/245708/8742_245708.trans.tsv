8742_245708_000011_000000	(5) Whether the image of God is in man by comparison with the Essence, or with all the Divine Persons, or with one of them?	(five) Whether the image of God is in man by comparison with the Essence, or with all the Divine Persons, or with one of them?
8742_245708_000012_000000	(6) Whether the image of God is in man, as to his mind only?	(six) Whether the image of God is in man, as to his mind only?
8742_245708_000018_000000	Objection 1: It would seem that the image of God is not in man.	Objection one: It would seem that the image of God is not in man.
8742_245708_000022_000001	74): "Where an image exists, there forthwith is likeness; but where there is likeness, there is not necessarily an image." Hence it is clear that likeness is essential to an image; and that an image adds something to likeness--namely, that it is copied from something else.	seventy four): "Where an image exists, there forthwith is likeness; but where there is likeness, there is not necessarily an image." Hence it is clear that likeness is essential to an image; and that an image adds something to likeness-namely, that it is copied from something else.
8742_245708_000022_000002	For an "image" is so called because it is produced as an imitation of something else; wherefore, for instance, an egg, however much like and equal to another egg, is not called an image of the other egg, because it is not copied from it.	For an "image" is so called because it is produced as an imitation of something else; wherefore, for instance, an egg, however much like and equal to another egg, is not called an image of the other egg, because it is not copied from it.
8742_245708_000023_000001	74): "Where there is an image there is not necessarily equality," as we see in a person's image reflected in a glass.	seventy four): "Where there is an image there is not necessarily equality," as we see in a person's image reflected in a glass.
8742_245708_000023_000002	Yet this is of the essence of a perfect image; for in a perfect image nothing is wanting that is to be found in that of which it is a copy.	Yet this is of the essence of a perfect image; for in a perfect image nothing is wanting that is to be found in that of which it is a copy.
8742_245708_000023_000003	Now it is manifest that in man there is some likeness to God, copied from God as from an exemplar; yet this likeness is not one of equality, for such an exemplar infinitely excels its copy. Therefore there is in man a likeness to God; not, indeed, a perfect likeness, but imperfect.	Now it is manifest that in man there is some likeness to God, copied from God as from an exemplar; yet this likeness is not one of equality, for such an exemplar infinitely excels its copy. Therefore there is in man a likeness to God; not, indeed, a perfect likeness, but imperfect.
8742_245708_000023_000004	And Scripture implies the same when it says that man was made "to" God's likeness; for the preposition "to" signifies a certain approach, as of something at a distance.	And Scripture implies the same when it says that man was made "to" God's likeness; for the preposition "to" signifies a certain approach, as of something at a distance.
8742_245708_000026_000001	Now a thing is said to be one not only numerically, specifically, or generically, but also according to a certain analogy or proportion.	Now a thing is said to be one not only numerically, specifically, or generically, but also according to a certain analogy or proportion.
8742_245708_000029_000000	Objection 1: It would seem that the image of God is to be found in irrational creatures.	Objection one: It would seem that the image of God is to be found in irrational creatures.
8742_245708_000031_000002	Therefore the whole universe is to the image of God, and not only man.	Therefore the whole universe is to the image of God, and not only man.
8742_245708_000034_000001	For instance, a worm, though from man it may originate, cannot be called man's image, merely because of the generic likeness.	For instance, a worm, though from man it may originate, cannot be called man's image, merely because of the generic likeness.
8742_245708_000034_000002	Nor, if anything is made white like something else, can we say that it is the image of that thing; for whiteness is an accident belonging to many species.	Nor, if anything is made white like something else, can we say that it is the image of that thing; for whiteness is an accident belonging to many species.
8742_245708_000034_000003	But the nature of an image requires likeness in species; thus the image of the king exists in his son: or, at least, in some specific accident, and chiefly in the shape; thus, we speak of a man's image in copper. Whence Hilary says pointedly that "an image is of the same species."	But the nature of an image requires likeness in species; thus the image of the king exists in his son: or, at least, in some specific accident, and chiefly in the shape; thus, we speak of a man's image in copper. Whence Hilary says pointedly that "an image is of the same species."
8742_245708_000035_000000	Now it is manifest that specific likeness follows the ultimate difference.	Now it is manifest that specific likeness follows the ultimate difference.
8742_245708_000035_000002	51) "approach so near to God in likeness, that among all creatures nothing comes nearer to Him." It is clear, therefore, that intellectual creatures alone, properly speaking, are made to God's image.	fifty one) "approach so near to God in likeness, that among all creatures nothing comes nearer to Him." It is clear, therefore, that intellectual creatures alone, properly speaking, are made to God's image.
8742_245708_000036_000001	Therefore even what falls short of the nature of an image, so far as it possesses any sort of likeness to God, participates in some degree the nature of an image.	Therefore even what falls short of the nature of an image, so far as it possesses any sort of likeness to God, participates in some degree the nature of an image.
8742_245708_000038_000001	Or else we may say that a part is not rightly divided against the whole, but only against another part.	Or else we may say that a part is not rightly divided against the whole, but only against another part.
8742_245708_000039_000001	Thus every creature is an image of the exemplar type thereof in the Divine mind.	Thus every creature is an image of the exemplar type thereof in the Divine mind.
8742_245708_000042_000000	Objection 1: It would seem that the angels are not more to the image of God than man is.	Objection one: It would seem that the angels are not more to the image of God than man is.
8742_245708_000043_000001	51), "man is so much to God's image that God did not make any creature to be between Him and man: and therefore nothing is more akin to Him." But a creature is called God's image so far as it is akin to God.	fifty one), "man is so much to God's image that God did not make any creature to be between Him and man: and therefore nothing is more akin to Him." But a creature is called God's image so far as it is akin to God.
8742_245708_000044_000001	But the intellectual nature does not admit of intensity or remissness; for it is not an accidental thing, since it is a substance.	But the intellectual nature does not admit of intensity or remissness; for it is not an accidental thing, since it is a substance.
8742_245708_000046_000001	First, we may consider in it that in which the image chiefly consists, that is, the intellectual nature.	First, we may consider in it that in which the image chiefly consists, that is, the intellectual nature.
8742_245708_000046_000004	Secondly, we may consider the image of God in man as regards its accidental qualities, so far as to observe in man a certain imitation of God, consisting in the fact that man proceeds from man, as God from God; and also in the fact that the whole human soul is in the whole body, and again, in every part, as God is in regard to the whole world.	Secondly, we may consider the image of God in man as regards its accidental qualities, so far as to observe in man a certain imitation of God, consisting in the fact that man proceeds from man, as God from God; and also in the fact that the whole human soul is in the whole body, and again, in every part, as God is in regard to the whole world.
8742_245708_000046_000006	But these do not of themselves belong to the nature of the Divine image in man, unless we presuppose the first likeness, which is in the intellectual nature; otherwise even brute animals would be to God's image.	But these do not of themselves belong to the nature of the Divine image in man, unless we presuppose the first likeness, which is in the intellectual nature; otherwise even brute animals would be to God's image.
8742_245708_000046_000007	Therefore, as in their intellectual nature, the angels are more to the image of God than man is, we must grant that, absolutely speaking, the angels are more to the image of God than man is, but that in some respects man is more like to God.	Therefore, as in their intellectual nature, the angels are more to the image of God than man is, we must grant that, absolutely speaking, the angels are more to the image of God than man is, but that in some respects man is more like to God.
8742_245708_000052_000000	Objection 1: It would seem that the image of God is not found in every man.	Objection one: It would seem that the image of God is not found in every man.
8742_245708_000052_000002	Therefore, as woman is an individual of the human species, it is clear that every individual is not an image of God.	Therefore, as woman is an individual of the human species, it is clear that every individual is not an image of God.
8742_245708_000053_000001	Therefore all men have not the conformity of image.	Therefore all men have not the conformity of image.
8742_245708_000054_000001	But by sin man becomes unlike God.	But by sin man becomes unlike God.
8742_245708_000056_000001	Now the intellectual nature imitates God chiefly in this, that God understands and loves Himself.	Now the intellectual nature imitates God chiefly in this, that God understands and loves Himself.
8742_245708_000056_000003	First, inasmuch as man possesses a natural aptitude for understanding and loving God; and this aptitude consists in the very nature of the mind, which is common to all men.	First, inasmuch as man possesses a natural aptitude for understanding and loving God; and this aptitude consists in the very nature of the mind, which is common to all men.
8742_245708_000056_000004	Secondly, inasmuch as man actually and habitually knows and loves God, though imperfectly; and this image consists in the conformity of grace.	Secondly, inasmuch as man actually and habitually knows and loves God, though imperfectly; and this image consists in the conformity of grace.
8742_245708_000057_000003	But in a secondary sense the image of God is found in man, and not in woman: for man is the beginning and end of woman; as God is the beginning and end of every creature.	But in a secondary sense the image of God is found in man, and not in woman: for man is the beginning and end of woman; as God is the beginning and end of every creature.
8742_245708_000057_000004	So when the Apostle had said that "man is the image and glory of God, but woman is the glory of man," he adds his reason for saying this: "For man is not of woman, but woman of man; and man was not created for woman, but woman for man."	So when the Apostle had said that "man is the image and glory of God, but woman is the glory of man," he adds his reason for saying this: "For man is not of woman, but woman of man; and man was not created for woman, but woman for man."

8742_245708_000061_000000	Objection 1: It would seem that the image of God does not exist in man as to the Trinity of Persons.	Objection one: It would seem that the image of God does not exist in man as to the Trinity of Persons.
8742_245708_000066_000001	Now the mode of origin is not the same in all things, but in each thing is adapted to the nature thereof; animated things being produced in one way, and inanimate in another; animals in one way, and plants in another.	Now the mode of origin is not the same in all things, but in each thing is adapted to the nature thereof; animated things being produced in one way, and inanimate in another; animals in one way, and plants in another.
8742_245708_000066_000002	Wherefore it is manifest that the distinction of the Divine Persons is suitable to the Divine Nature; and therefore to be to the image of God by imitation of the Divine Nature does not exclude being to the same image by the representation of the Divine Persons: but rather one follows from the other.	Wherefore it is manifest that the distinction of the Divine Persons is suitable to the Divine Nature; and therefore to be to the image of God by imitation of the Divine Nature does not exclude being to the same image by the representation of the Divine Persons: but rather one follows from the other.
8742_245708_000066_000003	We must, therefore, say that in man there exists the image of God, both as regards the Divine Nature and as regards the Trinity of Persons; for also in God Himself there is one Nature in Three Persons.	We must, therefore, say that in man there exists the image of God, both as regards the Divine Nature and as regards the Trinity of Persons; for also in God Himself there is one Nature in Three Persons.
8742_245708_000067_000000	Thus it is clear how to solve the first two objections.	Thus it is clear how to solve the first two objections.
8742_245708_000069_000002	First, because as the Son is like to the Father by a likeness of essence, it would follow of necessity if man were made in likeness to the Son, that he is made to the likeness of the Father.	First, because as the Son is like to the Father by a likeness of essence, it would follow of necessity if man were made in likeness to the Son, that he is made to the likeness of the Father.
