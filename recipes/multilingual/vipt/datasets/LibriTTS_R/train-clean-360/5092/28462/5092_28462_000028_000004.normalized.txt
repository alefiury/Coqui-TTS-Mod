The first land plant met was a tall grass, nine feet high, forming a meadow like margin in front of the forest. Pushing my way well back into the forest, I found it composed almost entirely of spruce and two hemlocks (Picea sitchensis, Tsuga heterophylla and t mertensiana) with a few specimens of yellow cypress.
