The valley of the Ohio River will probably average a mile in width at its upper level and, deep as it is to day, it was much deeper in preglacial times.
6115_58778_000004_000002	There is evidence that the whole bed of the river was from 100 to 150 feet deeper than it is at present.	There is evidence that the whole bed of the river was from one hundred to one hundred fifty feet deeper than it is at present.

6115_58778_000005_000000	For many years the writer lived upon one of the rivers tributary to the Ohio and often made trips by steamboat up and down the Ohio River. Traveling along this river a close observer will be struck by the exactness of the stratifications in the rock and in the coal beds to be seen on each side of the river.

6115_58778_000005_000003	All the rivers that are tributary to the Ohio, such as the Monongahela, the Alleghany, the Muskingum, the Tennessee, the Cumberland, the Kentucky, the Wabash, the Miami, the Licking, the Scioto, the Big Sandy, the Kanawha, the Hocking, and the Great Beaver, besides numerous smaller streams, have their own valleys that have been worn away by the same process, and to a greater depth than they now appear to be.

6115_58778_000005_000006	The great lakes, that were enlarged during the glacial period and in some cases wholly created--by the scooping out and damming up of the waterways and by piling glacial drift around their shores--have had some of their outlets raised to a higher level, and others have been created anew.

6115_58778_000009_000006	In the animal and vegetable world there is a period of life and growth, and a period of decay and death; and this seems to be the destiny of planets themselves as well as the things that live and grow upon them.
