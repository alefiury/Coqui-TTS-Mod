Before the glacial period the Wisconsin River made a detour some miles west of its present channel through the high hills in the region of Baraboo.

6115_58776_000004_000005	When the ice flowed down it surrounded these hills, yet did not sweep over their tops, but left great piles of glacial drift, both at the points where the river channel entered the hills and where it emerges from them.

6115_58776_000005_000000	There are hundreds and perhaps thousands of lakes that have been formed in one way or another through the power of glacial action.	There are hundreds and perhaps thousands of lakes that have been formed in one way or another through the power of glacial action.
6115_58776_000005_000001	These smaller inland lakes, so many of which are seen in northern Illinois, southern Wisconsin, and Minnesota, are due almost entirely to the great deposits of glacial drift that have been transported with the ice.

6115_58776_000005_000002	Wherever these "kettle holes" are found large bodies of ice have become anchored, while the ice behind it has carried the drift until it is covered over and piled up at the sides.

6115_58776_000005_000003	When these ice mountains melted away depressions were left which in some cases have resulted in lakes, and in others simply dry kettle holes.	When these ice mountains melted away depressions were left which in some cases have resulted in lakes, and in others simply dry kettle holes.
6115_58776_000005_000004	This process has been hinted at in a former chapter, but we give it here as one of the kinds of lakes formed during the glacial period.	This process has been hinted at in a former chapter, but we give it here as one of the kinds of lakes formed during the glacial period.

6115_58776_000005_000007	These lakes, however, are comparatively insignificant as compared with the great inland seas like Lake Superior and Lake Michigan, that undoubtedly owe their origin largely to the ice age.

6115_58776_000007_000000	Glacial lakes may be divided into three classes.	Glacial lakes may be divided into three classes.
6115_58776_000007_000001	Those found in the "kettle holes" of the terminal or medial moraines, and those that are formed by the deposition of the glacial drift, as, for instance, Devil's Lake, and those that are caused by ice forming dams across the valley of a river that lasted only during the ice age.

6115_58776_000008_000000	In order, however, that we may understand more fully the formation of these greater lakes it will be necessary for us to go back and examine the conditions that seem to have existed before the glacial period.

6115_58776_000009_000007	The question naturally arises, Where did all the dirt come from to fill up these great river beds and change the whole topography of the northern half of the continent?

6115_58776_000009_000008	Dr. Wright estimates that there is not less than 1,000,000 square miles of territory in North America covered with glacial debris to an average depth of 50 feet.	dr Wright estimates that there is not less than one million square miles of territory in North America covered with glacial debris to an average depth of fifty feet.

6115_58776_000015_000000	There may have existed something of a lake in preglacial times, through which the river ran, but it undoubtedly owes its present width to the grinding action of the irresistible icebergs and the piling up of debris on the shores.

6115_58776_000015_000002	Another glacier plowed down through Lake Michigan, widening it out to its present dimensions, while the glacial drift was deposited at what is now the head of the lake, filling up the old outlet and thus making a great dam.

6115_58776_000015_000005	It is supposed, however, that this lake is entirely the product of glacial action, as there is no evidence of an old river bed in its bottom; besides, it is much shallower than the other lakes.

6115_58776_000015_000006	The same action that formed Lake Erie filled up the old river bed running through the province of Ontario, so that when the ice receded Lake Erie became the new channel for the old river.

6115_58776_000015_000007	The same process filled up the Valley of the Mohawk to more than 100 feet in depth and also raised the Valley of the Hudson.	The same process filled up the Valley of the Mohawk to more than one hundred feet in depth and also raised the Valley of the Hudson.
6115_58776_000015_000011	At the same time it built great dams across the outlets which raised the surface of the water to a much higher level and caused them to form new outlets, thus changing the whole face of the country over which the ice drifted.

6115_58776_000017_000003	Of course such a lake could not be permanent, because, when the ice melted away, it again opened the channel and allowed the water to flow off.

6115_58776_000018_000006	The fact that in some places successive terraces are found does not disprove the theory, because it is more than likely that when the ice receded it did so in successive stages, remaining at different positions for a considerable length of time.

6115_58776_000019_000001	The ice did not stand with an even thickness over the surface of the glaciated area, but at some points it moved down in great lobes, which marked the lines of greatest pressure as well as the greatest accumulation.

6115_58776_000020_000000	All of the region about Winnipeg, in the Red River country, covering great areas of hundreds of miles in extent, is a level plain only lacking the coloring to give to one passing through it the effect of a great unruffled sea.
