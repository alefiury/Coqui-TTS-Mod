What flag is this you carry Along the sea and shore? The same our grandsires lifted up- The same our fathers bore. In many a battle's tempest It shed the crimson rain- What God has woven in his loom Let no man rend in twain. To Canaan, to Canaan, The Lord has led us forth, To plant upon the rebel towers The banners of the North. --Holmes.
