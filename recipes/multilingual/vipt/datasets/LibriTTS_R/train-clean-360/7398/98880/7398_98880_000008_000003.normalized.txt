As far as my personal observations go, I am disposed to affirm that the best mode of effecting a good result, is to give Apis three and Aconite three, in alternation, one drop of each preparation well shaken in a bottle containing twelve tablespoonfuls of water, and giving a tablespoonful every hour or three hours, if the danger is great, and in milder cases a full drop alternately morning and evening.
